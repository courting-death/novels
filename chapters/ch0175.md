## Chapter 175 — Humans and Demons Are One Family

Yang Kai wandered alone on the right peninsula, delving deeper with each step.

He had been in this right peninsula for over a day, and although he had discovered quite a few Black Mysterious Fruits along the way, he had no intention of helping the Yunxia Sect complete their task, so he naturally did not pick any.

The three-day deadline given by the Yunxia Sect's martial artists was likely the limit for ordinary people to endure here, but with the Earth Demon assisting him, Yang Kai had no worries about being affected by the evil aura.

On the contrary, the Earth Demon was in dire need of this evil aura to restore itself, devouring it with great delight.

Yang Kai decided to explore the right peninsula for a while, to see what kind of secrets it held, and then find a way to leave Yunxia Island.

The right peninsula was quite expansive, with several peaks that were not too high but rather steep, making it impossible for ordinary people to climb.

Yang Kai's target was these peaks; he believed he could certainly find some rare treasures there.

As he walked, Yang Kai suddenly halted his steps. He caught a whiff of a refreshing medicinal fragrance in the air. The scent was invigorating, making one feel as if they had been enlightened.

After carefully discerning the direction from which the fragrance came, Yang Kai walked to his right. Before long, a plant about half his height appeared before him.

At the top was a pink flower, blooming and exuding a pleasant fragrance. Upon closer inspection, the flower resembled a beautiful woman's face, smiling at him.

Moreover, the stem of the flower was peculiar, resembling a woman's graceful waist, curvaceous and translucent, provoking one's imagination.

"Beauty's Heart!" Yang Kai's eyes lit up. He hadn't expected to find such a treasure after just over a day of entering. According to the introduction in the pamphlet distributed by the Yunxia Sect disciples, this Beauty's Heart was an Earth-Grade Upper-Level medicinal herb. When refined into a pill with other materials, it could have miraculous effects when consumed by women. While it might not turn an ugly woman into a beauty, it could at least make a woman's skin smoother.

Yang Kai naturally would not be polite; he reached out and picked the Beauty's Heart, placing it into the medicinal basket on his back.

He continued to delve deeper into the exploration.

Perhaps Yang Kai had ventured into areas that ordinary people had never set foot in before. Since discovering that Beauty's Heart, he had repeatedly made gains.

The depths of the right peninsula were essentially an undeveloped treasure trove.

The martial artists of the Yunxia Sect did not dare to venture deep, fearing the influence of the evil aura, while ordinary people could not delve this far, leaving all the benefits to Yang Kai.

After crossing one peak after another, the medicinal basket behind Yang Kai gradually filled with rare herbs and spirit fruits.

The only regret was that although the right peninsula was quite large, it could not withstand Yang Kai's search. In just three to five days, he had essentially traversed the entire right peninsula.

The medicinal basket on his back was already more than half full. The items inside were at least of Earth-Grade Lower-Level quality, with even some Heaven-Grade rare herbs. If these were sold outside, they would easily fetch tens or even hundreds of thousands of taels of silver.

Moreover, there were not many dangers here, unlike the Black Wind Mountain, where demon beasts roamed, and those with lower strength would only be treated as food by the beasts.

During his time here, Yang Kai had only encountered a few wolves.

On the third day, the large ship from the Yunxia Sect arrived as scheduled. Yang Kai stood on a peak and observed this scene, but only sixty or seventy ordinary people managed to come out alive.

The others must have been consumed by the evil aura, driven into madness, ultimately dying on this right peninsula.

On the fourth day, Yang Kai stood at the foot of a small hill, gazing up at a mountain peak that was nearly three hundred zhang high.

This was the last small hill in this area. After exploring here, Yang Kai would have completed his journey across the entire right peninsula.

The Earth Demon, who had been silent, suddenly exclaimed excitedly, "Master, this peak seems to be the source of all the evil aura in the right peninsula!"

"Are you sure?" Yang Kai asked, surprised. He could also feel that the evil aura here was indeed much denser than in other places.

"Of course, I'm sure! Even my spirit is trembling..."

"Are you afraid?" Yang Kai asked curiously.

The Earth Demon cackled, "Not afraid, but excited! Master, if you had been hungry for a long time and a delicious feast was laid out before you, what would your reaction be?"

"Eat it!"

"I beg you, Master, give this old servant the chance!" In the distance, Yang Kai could even hear the Earth Demon swallowing.

Yang Kai smiled slightly and began to climb the steep mountain wall.

He was also eager to know what caused this right side of Yunxia Island to be so different!

As he climbed, Yang Kai observed his surroundings, hoping to find some rare treasures along the way. However, after reaching the summit, he found nothing, which was somewhat disappointing.

At the peak, Yang Kai stood upright and surveyed the area.

This mountain peak was peculiar; it was a flat summit. From a distance, it was evident that it was completely barren. Now that he stepped onto it, he felt it even more profoundly.

There was not a single blade of grass or tree; the soil on the summit was as red as blood, and the air was filled with a pungent smell.

Evil energy surged!

Yang Kai took a deep breath, his gaze fixed on a massive rock in the center of the peak.

This rock was also bright red, and at a glance, one could clearly see the blood energy evaporating from it, thick and suffocating.

With vigilance, he slowly approached the giant stone, and even when he got closer, there was still no danger.

Upon closer inspection, he saw several drops of bright red liquid in the center of the mirror-like giant stone, thick and bloody, resembling fresh blood.

"Coagulated Blood Pearl!" the Earth Demon exclaimed in wonder. His tone was surprisingly calm, clearly unfazed, but Yang Kai, having spent some time with this old demon, knew that for something to amaze him, it must be a top-tier treasure.

"Master, I understand now," the Earth Demon spoke. "It turns out that a small demon lord once fell here, which is why there is so much evil aura."

"Small demon lord?"

"Uh... compared to me, it is indeed a small demon lord, but for the martial artists here, it is a big shot," the Earth Demon said, his tone filled with pride and self-aggrandizement.

"How big can it be?" Yang Kai asked curiously.

"Exceeding one major realm above the Divine Roaming Realm!" The Earth Demon explained in a way Yang Kai could understand.

Yang Kai rubbed his forehead. He was currently in the Qi Movement Realm, and above that was the Separation and Union Realm, then the True Yuan Realm, followed by the Divine Roaming Realm.

This small demon lord... well, if the small demon lord exceeded the Divine Roaming Realm by one major realm, who else in the world could be its match? It would be the number one person in the world!

It had actually fallen here!

"Although this small demon lord's physical body perished, its evil aura still gathers here, creating the oddity of the right peninsula. If this old servant could absorb the remaining evil aura of this small demon lord, I should be able to restore some spiritual power. What a pity, it seems this small demon lord has been dead for quite some time, wasting a lot of it. Damn it, why couldn't it have waited for me to arrive before dying?" The Earth Demon referred to the small demon lord repeatedly, making Yang Kai's skin twitch.

"What about the Coagulated Blood Pearl you mentioned? What is it for?" Yang Kai asked, looking at the bright red liquid before him.

"This is the essence of the small demon lord's blood and flesh, condensed into a form, containing immense energy. This old servant has no physical body and cannot absorb it. If you were to absorb it, Master, it would definitely greatly enhance your strength, but I do not know if you can withstand it. The energy contained within is not something ordinary people can absorb."

Upon hearing this, Yang Kai's expression became uncertain.

Naturally, he hoped to significantly enhance his strength. But what if he couldn't withstand these few drops of Coagulated Blood Pearl?

When he voiced this concern, the Earth Demon chuckled, "Become a demon! Master, actually being a demon is not a bad thing. You can do whatever you want, kill whoever displeases you, and if you fancy a beautiful woman, just take her to play with. If you get tired of her, you can simply discard her without any worries. It's all about freedom and being unrestrained, isn't that delightful? Moreover, what is a human, and what is a demon? The world wrongly divides humans and demons. As long as humanity does not perish, who is truly a demon? Look at the actions of the Yunxia Sect; they are utterly inhumane and shameless, yet in the eyes of the world, they are not considered demons."

"Humans and demons are one family!" the Earth Demon concluded.

Yang Kai felt a stir in his heart but still hesitated to make a decision.

Just as he was in a quandary, he sensed a foul wind behind him, accompanied by a rustling sound. The Earth Demon shouted in alarm, "Master, be careful!"

In an instant, Yang Kai executed his self-created movement technique, swiftly dodging from his original position.

A loud crash echoed from that direction.

Looking up, Yang Kai's scalp tingled; a blood-colored giant python had appeared out of nowhere, its body thicker than his waist and over ten zhang long. Having missed its strike, it coiled its body, raising its head to glare at Yang Kai.

Its eyes were blood-red, and its massive mouth exhaled a scarlet snake tongue, looking terrifying.

The Earth Demon exclaimed, "This giant snake has actually swallowed the Coagulated Blood Pearls."

Without the Earth Demon’s reminder, Yang Kai had already realized this. No wonder there were only three drops of Coagulated Blood Pearl on the stone; it turned out the rest had been consumed by this giant snake.

"Come out!" Yang Kai flicked his hand, and the Earth Demon appeared before him, clutching the Soul-Breaking Spike.

Then, Yang Kai grabbed it and, under the incredulous gaze of the Earth Demon, hurled the Soul-Breaking Spike at the giant snake.

"Master..." the Earth Demon cried out pitifully, but suddenly realized that he had no physical body and had nothing to fear from the giant snake. He understood Yang Kai's intention, feeling wronged yet also admiring him. In the blink of an eye, Yang Kai had already devised a countermeasure against the giant snake, showcasing his quick thinking.

The giant snake was quite clever, swallowing the Soul-Breaking Spike in one bite. It felt nothing unusual but was enraged by Yang Kai's hostile action. Its tongue flicked back, and it lunged at Yang Kai with lightning speed.

The gaping maw of the giant snake was terrifying, and the foul odor that rushed towards him carried a potent toxicity.

Yang Kai held his breath, his figure flashing again, appearing directly behind the giant snake, his fist charged with True Yang Yuan Qi.

Flame Yang Explosion!
