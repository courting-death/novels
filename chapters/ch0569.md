## Chapter 569 — Tremendous Benefits

If Shan Qingluo truly betrayed them, then the women in her palace, as well as the people of Piaoxiang City, would surely face retaliation. Given the style of the warriors from Cangyun Evil Land, such revenge would be utterly horrifying and devastating.

Shan Qingluo was unlike other Evil Lords; she was not cold-blooded. Because she had some reservations, she naturally could not agree to Yang Kai’s request, no matter how much she wished to.

“You should all leave this place as soon as possible, or hide here without stepping outside,” Shan Qingluo sighed softly. “Only in this way can you remain safe. Take care of yourselves.”

After speaking, she cast a deep, sorrowful glance at Yang Kai, her beautiful eyes full of melancholy. Then, leading Bilo, she turned back along the original path.

In her heart, the seed of affection that Yang Kai had unwittingly planted was already sprouting and growing. Before long, it would fully mature. When that time came, the drawbacks of her Poison Widow Constitution would completely manifest.

She would stop at nothing to possess Yang Kai. And once they engaged in such intimacy, with the domineering and venomous nature of the Poison Widow Constitution, Yang Kai would be certain to die without a doubt.

Shan Qingluo dared not linger near Yang Kai any longer because the more contact they had, the faster the seed of affection grew.

She had to leave this place and get as far away from Yang Kai as possible.

Meng Wuya did not make things difficult for her and, as usual, opened the barrier to let her leave.

After Shan Qingluo’s departure, a heavy weight settled in everyone’s hearts.

As she said, there were now only two paths for everyone’s survival: either hide inside the barrier of Heavenly Journey Palace and stay put, or leave this place quickly while the Evil Lord and other Evil Lords were absent.

Both options ensured their own safety.

“Are we leaving or not?” Meng Wuya looked at Yang Kai and asked.

“Leave where?” Yang Kai smiled bitterly. If Zhongdu were destroyed, then with how vast the world was, there would be nowhere safe for them to take refuge.

Fleeing like a lost dog was not something Yang Kai wished to witness.

“If we don't leave, then we stay, but the strength of those in the mansion must be improved quickly,” Meng Wuya said, glancing around.

In the Succession War, their mansion’s strength had given them a complete and overwhelming advantage.

But when facing the onslaught of Cangyun Evil Land, such meager power was still far too weak.

Many had witnessed firsthand the formidable combat strength of several great Evil Lords. Their mysterious moves and incredible abilities still lingered vividly in their minds, stirring their blood and making them eager to train harder so they might one day match the Evil Lords.

“No matter the situation with the Eight Great Families and Zhongdu, we must have the power to protect ourselves,” Yang Kai’s thoughts gradually cleared, his previously confused eyes soon filled with determination as he grinned. “In that case, we will train.”

Everyone nodded in unison. With Heavenly Journey Palace’s barrier as protection, they could truly train without worry and improve their strength.

“Senior Li, once this difficulty is overcome, I will return the items from the overseas sects. Meanwhile, I hope all of you will stay here for now,” Yang Kai turned to Li Yuanchun and said.

Li Yuanchun was momentarily stunned. Although somewhat reluctant, he could only nod in agreement: “Alright.”

Living overseas long-term, he cared quite a bit about the mainland. Having witnessed previously unheard-of Secret Treasures and exceptional experts not found overseas, he naturally wished to stay and observe. Opportunities like this were rare.

Especially Meng Wuya — Li Yuanchun was particularly attentive to him, always feeling there was something different about that man.

The mansion quickly returned to calm. Among the ruins, only Yang Kai’s mansion remained intact.

Everyone carried out their duties as usual, training without the anxiety that would accompany an imminent disaster.

On that day, Yang Kai allocated a large amount of Wan Yao Ling Ye to Xia Ningshang for her alchemy.

He also assembled all the Blood Servants in the mansion and handed each a small piece of Wan Yao Ling Paste.

Meng Wuya had said Wan Yao Ling Paste concealed some wondrous Heavenly Dao principles which, with its aid, could help one easily comprehend the Heavenly Dao.

Though Wan Yao Ling Paste was extremely precious and Yang Kai held only a small amount, now was the time to provide it to trusted people.

Yang Kai hoped these Blood Servants, who had already reached the peak of the Divine Roaming Realm, could, through the paste, glimpse the mysteries beyond the Divine Roaming Realm and break through their current cultivation.

Once successful, these Blood Servants would become his strongest trump cards.

Even without Meng Wuya’s Heavenly Journey Palace, Yang Kai’s mansion would then have the power to defend itself against the assaults of Cangyun Evil Land.

One day later, Ying Jiu returned from Zhongdu with news that shocked Yang Kai.

Large numbers of warriors and Demonic Beasts from Cangyun Evil Land had attacked Zhongdu, entering through the northwest corner gate. They slaughtered all living beings within dozens of li.

The Gao Family, stationed in that corner, suffered heavy losses. A Grand Elder beyond the Divine Roaming Realm was killed by the Evil Lord, and the family’s experts were decimated. The entire clan was forced to retreat to the Kang Family’s territory directly north of Zhongdu.

The might of Cangyun Evil Land was overwhelming, beyond everyone’s expectations.

The other six great clans also dispatched reinforcements, gathering in Kang Family territory for a showdown with Cangyun Evil Land.

When Ying Jiu left Zhongdu, both forces were still in a standoff, with no battle yet started. The outcome at present was unknown.

“How are things at the Yang Family?” Yang Kai asked anxiously.

“The family is safe. Cangyun Evil Land hasn’t attacked the south gate yet. There are no immediate problems. Fourth Master Yang and his wife are both safe. The family hasn't sent them into battle,” Ying Jiu replied.

Relieved that his parents didn't have to fight, Yang Kai asked again, “Did you not have them come to War City and join me?”

Ying Jiu shook his head. “There’s no news from Zhongdu regarding the situation in War City. In fact, Fourth Master Yang and his wife are deeply concerned about your safety.”

Yang Kai nodded lightly. With all the carnage here, only those in his mansion were alive. Zhongdu would indeed have no news of this battle.

“I understand. You may go,” Yang Kai said, taking out a small piece of Wan Yao Ling Paste and instructing Ying Jiu to take it.

Ying Jiu accepted and quickly withdrew.

After some thought, Yang Kai summoned the Golden Feather Eagle and sent a letter to the Yang Family in Zhongdu to report that all was well and to urge them to come to War City if possible.

Yang Kai suspected, however, that Fourth Master Yang’s character meant he would likely not leave the family.

Since Cangyun Evil Land had entered Zhongdu from the northwest, the Yang Family should have no immediate trouble. Besides, the Eight Great Families were formidable; once they adjusted, Cangyun Evil Land’s advance would not proceed so smoothly.

Once everything was arranged, Yang Kai swiftly entered seclusion.

Inside his room, Yang Kai held his breath and focused, sitting cross-legged.

His Divine Sense slipped into his Sea of Consciousness, and his Spirit Body manifested, staring blankly at a large, pure mass of Divine Sense energy floating above his Sea of Consciousness.

This large, pure mass of Divine Sense energy was what remained after Golden Pupil Eye extinguished the Spirit Body of that square-faced Elder from the Ye Family.

Though two or three days had passed, Yang Kai still hardly dared believe that Golden Pupil Eye was merely a streak of golden light that had wiped out a Spirit Body beyond the Divine Roaming Realm.

Only now did he have the time and energy to examine this pure energy left behind.

After careful sensation, Yang Kai was astonished to discover that this vast energy was not only powerful and pure but also contained many wondrous laws.

These laws were surely the result of the Ye Family expert’s comprehension of the Heavenly Dao and Martial Dao accumulated over the years.

Since his Spirit Body was eradicated by Golden Pupil Eye, all thoughts were completely purified, leaving only this pure energy saturated with those insights.

Seeing this, Yang Kai’s expression brightened. He had not expected Golden Pupil Eye’s strike to bring him such a tremendous benefit.

Divine Sense power from experts beyond the Divine Roaming Realm was the fruit of decades or even centuries of dedicated cultivation, and yet it now lingered inside Yang Kai’s Sea of Consciousness.

Yang Kai’s Spirit Body moved before that mass of energy and sat facing it, willing it into himself. The vast and pure energy began to flow in continuously.

In an instant, Yang Kai was exhilarated, as if he had been starving for many days and had suddenly been served a feast.

His Spirit Body almost visibly strengthened and expanded.

Below, his Sea of Consciousness heaved with waves, reflecting the fluctuations of his mind.

The vast energy no longer held the Ye Family expert’s memories but was an extremely pure energy anyone could absorb to bolster themselves.

And without the slightest drawback.

Yang Kai savored it like nectar.

As he absorbed, the treasure island formed by the Five-Colored Warm Spirit Lotus shimmered with vibrant hues.

Time passed unknown. When Yang Kai had completely absorbed the pure energy within his Sea of Consciousness, he slowly regained his senses.

With some detection, Yang Kai was shaken.

This seclusion alone had enabled another breakthrough.

Quietly and without fanfare, he had reached the third stage of the Divine Roaming Realm and was energetically progressing toward the fourth stage.

That Spirit Body’s pure energy from beyond the Divine Roaming Realm had achieved this level of benefit, which made Yang Kai’s mind race.

If he could slay several more experts beyond the Divine Roaming Realm and absorb all their lingering Divine Sense energy, wouldn’t his power increase rapidly?

This thought instantly invigorated Yang Kai, causing a subtle excitement to glimmer on his face.

Struggling to suppress this impulse, Yang Kai calmed himself down.

His previous kill of that Ye Family expert was also thanks to Golden Pupil Eye’s sudden power. He still did not know how to control that single golden eye. If he could master its power, this idea might well become reality.

Thinking this, Yang Kai wasted no time and extended his Divine Sense to contact the closed single eye, attempting to see if he could refine it.

This thing should be a Mystery-Grade Secret Treasure — a Divine Soul Treasure. He did not know who forged it. However, one that could single-handedly kill a master beyond the Divine Roaming Realm must not be merely of Mystery-Grade tier.

Mystery-Grade was not enough power for such a feat.

Above Mystery-Grade was Spirit-Grade, a legendary classification.

He already possessed a Spirit-Grade Secret Treasure—what an incredible revelation.

This Divine Soul Treasure probably rivaled Meng Wuya’s Heavenly Journey Palace in power.
