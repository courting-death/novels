## Chapter 530 — Will You Ever Be Destitute?

Among the crowd, Ye Xinrou looked at Yang Zhao with eyes full of disappointment. She never expected that after just one setback, the Yang Family Second Young Master would become like this.

A wave of inexplicable disgust surged in her heart, and she secretly resented him deeply.

She had invested quite a lot to win Yang Zhao’s favor, yet now, not even a glimmer of hope remained to see him victorious in the Succession War.

Raising her gaze toward Yang Kai's mansion, Ye Xinrou’s eyes shimmered with a strange light. A mischievous flush colored her delicate face as she bit her thin lips, as though an idea had just sparked in her mind.

At Yang Kai’s mansion, barely half a day after the guests returned, someone came with news: over a hundred disciples from Lingxiao Pavilion had already arrived!

Yang Kai was overjoyed and hurriedly went out to greet them.

Sure enough, Su Yan and the others had arrived. After Xia Ningshang received the news, her youthful face flushed with excitement as she ran out of the alchemy room.

The two young ladies hadn’t seen each other for a long time, and at this joyful reunion, they naturally had much to talk about. Especially since they shared a common man—Yang Kai. Their conversation soon turned toward him, whispering and chuckling, pointing at Yang Kai teasingly.

Qin Ze from Yao Wang Valley chased after Xia Ningshang like a man with his butt on fire. He originally intended to drag her back to alchemy, but upon seeing her happy expression, he returned alone.

He felt reluctant to interrupt Xia Ningshang chatting with acquaintances. In his memory, this young Senior Uncle with exceptional alchemy skills had few friends. She usually spent all her time in the alchemy room and nothing else.

Such a young girl should have more important pursuits beyond alchemy, Qin Ze thought, sighing.

The mansion was lively. The Blood Battle Gang and Fengyu Tower members were already familiar with the Lingxiao Pavilion disciples, and everyone quickly mingled into one.

Yang Kai cast a secret glance at Su Yan and Xia Ningshang conversing nearby. The sight was pleasing to his eyes, and he felt extremely satisfied.

“Brother-in-law,” Su Mu came running over. His injuries had healed. After drinking the Spirit Milk, such wounds healed quickly. He approached Yang Kai quietly and asked in a low voice, “Why do I feel like Senior Sister Xia’s relationship with you isn’t ordinary?”

Yang Kai snorted and gave him a sideways glance. “Little kids, don’t pry into these things. This is the world of adults.”

Su Mu pouted. “You’re not much older than me!”

Straightening his face, Yang Kai said calmly, “Those who hurt you are dead now. If something like this happens again, endure it if you can. The rigid break easily. Understand?”

Su Mu chuckled, “Got it!”

Then he shook his head and babbled, “Such a pity. I wanted to train hard and avenge them myself, but now it seems I have no chance. Those two guys weren’t that formidable anyway.”

“Did you get some chances in the Inheritance Celestial Cave?” Yang Kai tilted his head and smiled slightly.

Both he and Su Yan had received the ultimate inheritance there. The Hu Family sisters had gained the Consonant Spirit Technique there, and even Lan Chudie had some gains.

He did not believe Su Mu wouldn’t have encountered some opportunity there either, considering how fast his cultivation had progressed these last few years, almost like a different person.

Su Mu laughed lightly, scratching his head, and nodded. “Yes, a bit. I’ve already told my sister about it.”

Yang Kai nodded slightly but did not inquire further. “Keep working hard. Don’t waste your chance. The inheritance in the Inheritance Celestial Cave... is not ordinary.”

“What do you mean?” Su Mu asked, confused.

“Nothing, just remember it.” Yang Kai shook his head and refrained from explaining.

He had only lately sensed this himself. The things in the Inheritance Celestial Cave seemed to transcend this world’s level. Whether it was his and Su Yan’s Dual Cultivation Technique or the Hu Family sisters’ Consonant Spirit Technique, none should have been created by cultivators of this world.

Moreover, recently Yang Kai had seen many unexpected events, broadening his horizons and enabling him to identify some extraordinary information.

The people of Lingxiao Pavilion were settled in the mansion by Qiu Yimeng’s arrangement.

Within War City, it was not only Ling Taixu present. The sect’s four remaining Elders also resided there, hiding under Ling Taixu’s protection, never once discovered.

After Ling Taixu’s recent appearance, the four Elders too came to the mansion.

After two or three days of bustling activity, Yang Kai’s mansion gradually calmed. Everyone took care of their tasks in an orderly manner.

Having shared hardships just days before, the various forces in the mansion grew more united. Though from different sects, they coexisted peacefully like siblings, with no disputes over distribution of benefits erupting into chaos.

When new pills were produced, for instance, everyone politely deferred to each other, keeping the atmosphere harmonious.

During these few days, Yang Kai focused on only one thing.

Cleaning up the Bamboo Segment Gang.

The news of the Lingxiao Pavilion disciples’ hideout had been leaked by the Bamboo Segment Gang. After Pang Chi returned to Zhongdu, he immediately captured the culprit Mu Nandou.

The next day, Pang Chi personally delivered Mu Nandou’s severed head to Yang Kai’s mansion.

According to Pang Chi, Mu Nandou betrayed the information solely because Ye Xinrou from the Ye Family promised him benefits and sent him two young and beautiful Ye Family maids as a bribe.

Because those two maids came from the Ye Family, Pang Chi did not dare to act rashly, only bringing them to Yang Kai’s mansion for judgment.

For such a shortsighted fool as Mu Nandou, Yang Kai had no intention of wasting much effort. Since he was dead, there was nothing more to say. The two maids were not killed but detained and put to work in the mansion.

They were involuntarily used as bait in this mess and were not at fault themselves.

Pang Chi quickly returned to Zhongdu to gather resources for Yang Kai.

After Pang Chi left, Qiu Yimeng approached Yang Kai, pulling him into a room, closing door and windows, her expression serious.

Seeing her tense face, Yang Kai silently chuckled. If anyone saw this, they might misunderstand.

Qiu Yimeng had been busy these past days, handling many matters after the battle: tallying casualties, providing consolation and compensation, arranging housing for Lingxiao Pavilion disciples, and only now was she free.

After they sat down in her room, Yang Kai poured her a cup of tea. Qiu Yimeng drank it in one gulp, gasping heavily, seeming much relieved.

“Is there something you wish to say?” Yang Kai gently asked, sipping his tea.

Qiu Yimeng sighed and spoke, “About Nan Sheng and Xiang Chu...”

“Do you think I went too far?” Yang Kai interrupted her.

Qiu Yimeng nodded gently, speaking frankly, “They are after all future heirs of first-rate noble families. You killed them so recklessly. How do you intend to handle the aftermath? Do you think the Xiang and Nan families will let this go so easily?”

“They won’t,” Yang Kai shook his head. He had anticipated this before killing Xiang Chu and Nan Sheng but killed them nonetheless.

“But there is nothing the Xiang and Nan families can do to me!” Yang Kai chuckled lightly. “If they truly dared to act against me, I would admire their courage, but they won’t dare.”

Apart from the massive power of the Yang Family that the Xiang and Nan families could not match, Yang Kai’s mansion was now filled with many formidable experts.

Eight Blood Servants, one beyond Divine Roaming Realm, two masters at the pinnacle of Divine Roaming Realm… Even if the Xiang and Nan families sought revenge for their fallen heirs, they would have to consider whether they have sufficient strength.

“You…” Qiu Yimeng looked at Yang Kai with eyes full of both love and hatred, suddenly smiling: “But to tell you the truth, I also feel very satisfied that you killed Xiang Chu and Nan Sheng! Those two were truly insidious and despicable. If the Xiang and Nan families were inherited by them, they would never have a day in the sun.”

Yang Kai snorted, “People like them, even if I hadn’t killed them this time, someone else would have eventually.”

“Ah, that may be true, but the problem now is that the Xiang and Nan families surely won’t compromise. The Yang Family is probably under pressure. The Succession War has never before seen the death of heirs from first-rate noble families. This matter could blow up. But judging by the Yang Family’s arrogance and overbearing nature, they probably won’t care, but they also won’t cover for you. Meaning the feud between those two families and you will not involve the Yang Family.”

“That much I know.”

Qiu Yimeng’s expression grew serious. “If I were them, I would wait for an opportunity... wait until you fall into hard times, then strike when you’re down... Do you think you will ever be destitute?”

“That’s hard to say.” Yang Kai shook his head.

Qiu Yimeng lifted her gaze, locking her eyes with Yang Kai’s deeply, whispering, “It seems we are worrying about the same thing.”

Yang Kai smiled slightly. “Women who are too clever aren’t liked.”

“You like dumb ones?” Qiu Yimeng stood up and turned around. “Xiaoman is dumb, and you don’t seem to like her either.”

“I do! Her chest is huge, even bigger than yours,” Yang Kai said without hesitation, staring at Qiu Yimeng’s chest, suddenly thoughtful as he stroked his chin, murmuring, “If I bury my head in there, I wonder if I’d suffocate...”

Qiu Yimeng’s face darkened. She hastily crossed her arms to shield her chest, angrily saying, “Behave yourself!”

Yang Kai’s expression immediately turned solemn, admitting helplessly, “This matter was beyond my expectations. I did not foresee that I would cause such a commotion by ascending to Divine Roaming Realm.”

Exposing some of his power and foundation was one thing, but what troubled him most was attracting the attention of the eight people from Fengshen Hall. That was not what he wanted.

“Ah, you were too careless,” Qiu Yimeng smiled wryly. She and Yang Kai shared the same worry.

The Eight Great Families abhor wickedness. Yang Kai’s dark side naturally made them extremely wary. If any of the Eight Great Families’ members practiced demonic techniques, they would either be annihilated or have their cultivation crippled. Yang Kai’s survival was thanks to Ling Taixu and others, not Yang Liting’s consideration of blood ties.

“It can’t be hidden,” Yang Kai shook his head. “There’s no wall in this world that the wind can’t pass through.”

Yang Kai was already quite satisfied to have hidden this as well as he had. Judging by the circumstances, even if he hadn’t entered demonic state before, when he ascended to Divine Roaming Realm, the energy inside his Proud Bone Golden Body would have erupted uncontrollably, revealing his secret to those eight people then as well.
