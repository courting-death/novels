## Chapter 336 — Evil Spirit Spring Eye

One's arm cannot twist the thigh; here the old man's strength is paramount, and although Yu Qing felt resentful in his heart, he did not dare to show it in front of him.

The four young men who came with the old man descended and eagerly examined the enchanting servants surrounding the male disciples of the Xiaoyao Sect. Those enchanting servants had eyes like blooming peaches, casting flirtatious glances, seemingly indifferent to the precarious situation at hand and whether the men beside them felt jealous.

“If you don’t want to be drained of your cultivation by these women, don’t get any ideas about them!” the old man casually reminded.

Immediately, the four young men flushed and averted their gazes.

The enchanting servants of the Xiaoyao Sect could absorb a portion of a man’s cultivation when engaging with him and then transfer that back to the Xiaoyao Sect male disciples during their intimate encounters, thus enhancing their strength.

Therefore, the enchanting servants of the Xiaoyao Sect had no restrictions in matters of intimacy, and the male disciples of the Xiaoyao Sect seldom disciplined them. Instead, they were quite willing to let them seduce other men to steal various benefits.

Additionally, these enchanting servants had various miraculous effects; in the eyes of the Xiaoyao Sect male disciples, they were not people but tools.

Clearly, the old man was very familiar with the Xiaoyao Sect’s various methods, fearing that his juniors would suffer losses, which is why he spoke up to remind them.

After speaking, he frowned deeply, scanning below with piercing eyes that gleamed with light, fixated on the position of the so-called evil spirit spring eye, his expression revealing a flicker of intrigue.

Turning to Shen Yi, he said, “The brat from Ghost King Valley, it seems you have some understanding of the evil spirit spring eye; why don’t you explain it to them? Otherwise, when the time comes, they might not even know how they died.”

“Yes!” Shen Yi also intended to explain things to Yang Kai. Now that the old man had said so, he no longer declined.

“The evil spirit spring eye is indeed a spring; the two ladies aren’t mistaken. What emerges from the spring is evil water, which is harmful to us but greatly beneficial to the evil spirits in this place. As long as they are given enough time, they can fully absorb this evil water, becoming stronger and more solid. Thus, this stuff is very attractive to them, which is why they come here,” Shen Yi explained gravely.

“Whenever the evil spirit spring eye appears and the evil water erupts, the evil spirits inside the Bloodthirsty Evil Cave become extremely unstable. As you can see, they are fighting fiercely with each other over the spring water below. For the moment, we probably don’t face much danger, but after some time… once these evil spirits become berserk, we will be attacked. It’s truly unfortunate; evil spirit spring eyes might not appear for years, yet we’ve unexpectedly encountered one.”

“Ah, what should we do?” Zhao Rong of the Baoqi Sect exclaimed, “Should we hurry and escape now?”

“Escape where?” Shen Yi replied with a bitter smile. “There’s nowhere to flee. Standing here may allow us to live a bit longer; once we leave, we might die even faster.”

“Hehe, the kid is right,” the old man nodded with a dark smile. “Even an old man like myself has been forced here. You youngsters think you can escape? That’s simply wishful thinking!”

After a pause, the old man looked at everyone with a smile, “So? Do you want to join forces with me to see if we can carve out a path to survival?”

Shen Yi glanced at him and frowned, asking, “What plan do you have, Senior?”

“No clever plan; only killing!” the old man chuckled lightly. “Your strengths may not be very high, but fortunately, you are numerous. Standing on that platform, as long as you don’t give up, there may still be hope. Moreover, since you dared to come to the Bloodthirsty Evil Cave, you must have brought quite a few treasures to restrain evil spirits, right?”

“Yes.” Shen Yi nodded. Unlike Yang Kai, they had come well-prepared to face the Bloodthirsty Evil Cave, and they had not used their treasures yet because there had been no need.

“Then that’s good. When the fighting begins, feel free to unleash everything you’ve learned in your lives. Hehehe… If I can find some spare energy, I will certainly lend you a hand,” the old man grinned, appearing quite amiable.

Shen Yi offered his thanks, “Then I appreciate your goodwill, Senior.”

He did not believe that the old man would take such care of their group; the number of evil spirits was simply too great, and if they died quickly, it would also increase pressure on the old man. The current situation on both stone platforms was indeed one where they depended on each other.

“In a crucial moment, I can lend you a hand, but I have one condition!” the old man said with a cheerful tone.

“What condition?” Shen Yi inquired.

The old man’s gaze was fixed intently on the evil spirit spring eye, and he said solemnly, “If we can get through this crisis, I want what is in that spring! Anyone who dares to snatch it will be killed without mercy!”

“Young ones like us only seek to survive!” Shen Yi replied coldly.

“Best if that is the case!” the old man sneered, saying no more.

“What’s in the spring?” Yang Kai whispered curiously. The old man seemed quite interested in whatever was in the spring, leading Yang Kai to guess it must be something extraordinary.

“The evil spirit essence!” Shen Yi whispered back, “But it’s certainly a very special evil spirit essence, and the energy contained within is immensely powerful.”

“A very special evil spirit essence?” Yang Kai couldn’t help but feel tempted; Shan Qingluo had said that certain evil spirit essences contained energy to enhance divine sense or various martial skills…

How inferior could the essence from the evil spirit spring eye possibly be?

However, given the current situation, Yang Kai had to suppress his desires and focus on preserving his life.

On both platforms, everyone was on high alert. The evil spirit spring water below was rising higher and higher, and within the dark, ink-like water, dozens of bright evil spirit essences floated, dazzlingly attracting everyone’s gaze and provoking greedy hearts.

If one could descend, they could directly harvest dozens of these, which would be equivalent to what one might obtain after several days of training in the Bloodthirsty Evil Cave.

Originally, there was much more than just this essence. During this time, around one or two hundred evil spirits had already died, yet more essences had vanished into the evil spirit spring water, transformed into energy within.

Even though everyone felt greed rising, no one dared to leave the platform. They could only watch longingly, their hearts filled with regret.

After a while, many evil spirits below suddenly screamed, their violet bodies flickering with unstable light, creating a chilling aura extending a hundred zhang around them, foreboding like a hellish realm.

“Be careful, all of you strive to survive! Hahahaha!” the old man laughed loudly.

Before his laughter faded, dozens of evil spirits surged up from below, drawn by the violent energy of the martial artists. They split into two groups and charged forward.

Amidst sharp howls, six or seven evil spirits attacked Yang Kai and the others' platform, surrounding them completely.

They had long been awaiting this moment. Together, they unleashed their long-prepared martial skills.

The purple evil spirits were already quite strong, but with the crowd gathered on the platform, although their movements were somewhat hindered, their mutual protection was flawless.

As the evil spirits attempted to strike, they were repelled, their colors shifting wildly.

Before the evil spirits could leap once more, the disciples from Ghost King Valley and Baoqi Sect unleashed their treasures.

The Ghost King Valley disciples brought two treasures that restrained evil spirits, one of fire attribute and the other of lightning attribute.

Flames burst forth, burning two evil spirits and forcing out their anguished screams, while electric arcs jolted them, making them shudder continuously.

Both treasures were upper-tier Earth-Grade items; while not as useful as Yang Kai's True Yang Yuan Qi, they nevertheless proved effective, especially in dealing with evil spirits.

Tao Yang from Baoqi Sect, boasting a particularly deep foundation, directly took out a Heaven-Grade treasure, conjuring a cloud of flame that enveloped two evil spirits, urging his Yuan Qi to refine them.

The two evil spirits screamed and struggled but could not escape the reach of the burning cloud.

The disciples from both sects, relying on the might of their treasures, managed to withstand four evil spirits with remarkable prowess.

The Hu sisters combined their efforts; while they did not have treasures specifically designed to counter evil spirits, executing the Consonant Spirit Technique significantly boosted their strength. Together, they successfully tackled an evil spirit without falling behind.

Yang Kai dealt with one alone, unleashing his True Yang Yuan Qi to envelop the evil spirit, and a sword manifested from condensed Yang Liquid in his hand. With each swing, the color of the evil spirit rapidly dimmed.

Each attack seemed to shatter its form progressively.

Though he possessed the Shura Sword, Yang Kai felt that using the weapon formed from Yang Liquid was more effective against the evil spirits, as their attributes countered each other.

Now, trying it out, it indeed proved to be as expected.

The battle escalated fiercely; none of the six evil spirits that charged up managed to breach their defenses, all kept at bay.

Seeing the situation improving, everyone took a deep breath and became even more vigorous in their attacks.

Before long, the evil spirit Yang Kai was dealing with was shattered, leaving behind a ball of evil spirit essence.

Without a moment's hesitation, Yang Kai reached out, directly collecting the essence into his palm, and hurried to attack the evil spirit the Hu sisters were grappling with.

Hu Jiao’er looked at Yang Kai in surprise; she hadn't expected him to handle an evil spirit alone faster than her and her sister working together.

In the two years they hadn’t met, this rascal had greatly improved! It seemed she had underestimated him.

The high platform where Yang Kai and the others stood was handling things without much difficulty. Similarly, the old man and those from the Xiaoyao Sect had it comparatively easy. After all, the old man possessed the strength of the Divine Roaming Realm, while the four young men beside him were also quite powerful. Together with the group from Xiaoyao Sect, they significantly outmatched those from Ghost King Valley and Baoqi Sect in combat strength.

In fact, the old man was not only managing the evil spirits but also keeping an eye on Yang Kai and his group, seemingly worried they might collapse under the first wave of attacks.

Upon witnessing the manifestation of Yang Kai’s True Yuan, the old man’s eyes brightened, and he shouted, “That young man, do you want to come over to my side? I can guarantee your safety!”

With his strength, combined with Yang Kai’s True Yuan, their joint power would increase greatly!

Moreover, seeing Yang Kai's impressive combat ability naturally sparked the old man’s desire to recruit him.
