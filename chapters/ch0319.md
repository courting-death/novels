## Chapter 319 — This One is Not Simple

“Don’t tell me you look down on a Mystery-Grade Pill?” Le Yu was taken aback; this was no ordinary Pill, but one that could restore Divine Sense power. The value of a single Pill was more than an entire bottle of other Mystery-Grade Pills, worth at least hundreds of thousands of taels of silver.

Mystery-Grade Pills were not something that could be casually refined. There were no more than thirty alchemists in the entire Han capable of refining such pills. Yet, this kid seemed to think nothing of it. Did he really have such high standards?

“Not interested!” Yang Kai said coldly.

“Damn it!” Le Yu's gaze suddenly turned icy, his True Essence erupting violently, “I don’t care whether you're interested or not; once I set my sights on you, you have to fight, even if you don’t want to!”

As he spoke, the ground beneath his feet shattered, and stones flew in all directions.

Dark purple evil light emanated from Le Yu’s body, transforming into waves of invisible energy that rushed toward Yang Kai.

“Le Yu, if you dare to harm him, you’re asking for death!” Bilo’s face turned pale as she shouted frantically.

Although Yang Kai had just defeated several True Essence Realm martial artists in a flash, showcasing formidable strength, Le Yu was different. He was a notorious figure within the entire Cangyun Evil Land. Despite his unremarkable appearance, his combat prowess was extremely fearsome, and very few of the younger generation could contend with him.

Moreover, Le Yu had a notorious penchant for killing; anyone who had fought against him had ended up dead, without exception.

Bilo did not know if Yang Kai could match him, so how could she not worry? If anything happened to Yang Kai, how would she explain it to Shan Qingluo?

Amid her panic, Yang Kai’s own True Essence surged forth vigorously.

Puff, puff, puff…

The solid attacks formed from their respective True Essence collided with each other, resulting in a deadlock. Le Yu's invisible attacks were completely neutralized.

Before either could catch their breath, Yang Kai suddenly noticed a smug smile creeping onto Le Yu's lips.

His expression changed, and he soared upward, leaping into the air.

Swish…

A beam of evil light suddenly shot up from beneath the ground, nearly penetrating the soles of Yang Kai's feet.

“Oh?” Le Yu’s eyes glinted coldly; he did not expect Yang Kai to be so alert and able to evade that sudden strike.

A ball of flame erupted, and the soaring Yang Kai resembled a flaming fireball. The True Yang Yuan Qi was pushed to its limit, descending like an eagle striking from the sky, imbued with destructive power.

Sensing the searing heat and pressure coming from above, Le Yu dared not be careless; he raised both palms, bracing himself as if hoisting a cauldron against the incoming force.

Boom, boom, boom…

The violent True Essence crashed against each other like huge waves, each impact radiating an aura of light. As these collisions occurred, Le Yu’s towering frame gradually sank toward the ground.

It was not that his strength was inferior to Yang Kai's, but rather that the earth could not endure such bombardment. The area around Le Yu had cracked like a tortoise shell, with fissures radiating from him.

The cold light in Yang Kai’s eyes deepened. With no regard for consequences, he unleashed his True Essence vigorously, intending to drive Le Yu underground.

Realizing Yang Kai’s intentions, Le Yu roared like a mad beast; his muscles bulged as he exerted all his strength and suddenly launched a punch.

Half of Piaoxiang City trembled, the nearby shops destroyed in a single blow, and the attendants screamed in unison, quickly fleeing in all directions.

Even Letian Pharmacy was unable to escape unharmed.

Yang Kai's expression turned serious, having no intention of dodging.

Triple Flame Yang Explosion!

Three volatile bursts of energy instantly combined under Yang Kai's direction.

Boom…

Le Yu's body bent, half of him getting buried into the ground, and using the recoil, Yang Kai gracefully landed nearby, stabilizing himself as his complexion turned a shade paler.

In this blow, Le Yu appeared unscathed, while it was Yang Kai who had suffered the loss.

But being physically driven into the ground caused Le Yu to lose face!

A profound silence enveloped the area, everyone stunned as they looked at Yang Kai, their eyes filled with shock and disbelief. They had not expected him to incapacitate Le Yu to such an extent.

“What’s going on?” Many figures flew in from all directions, all experts from the Divine Roaming Realm in the city.

Under Shan Qingluo's management, public fights rarely occurred in Piaoxiang City. However, the noise from today’s battle was too tremendous, prompting those from the Divine Roaming Realm to come and assess the situation.

Upon realizing that it was Le Yu engaged in combat, they were all taken aback.

The most shocking part was that Le Yu seemed to be at a disadvantage, half of his body buried in the dirt, while the person fighting him was merely a youth!

“What exactly happened? Who is Le Yu fighting?” They flew to the side, asking several old men from Letian Pharmacy.

“Who is he, that he can confront Le Yu head-on?” 

One of the experts from the Le family chuckled bitterly, “We also don’t know where this kid came from. According to Miss Bilo, he is a distinguished guest of the Queen!”

“A distinguished guest of the Queen? Why haven’t we heard of this?”

“Forget that for now. What should we do about this?”

“It’s over; the young master has never suffered such a loss. This time, I’m afraid it won’t end well.”

“Hehe…” In the midst of this, Le Yu suddenly chuckled, abruptly raising his head and looking at Yang Kai with a sinister gaze. The chilling intent in his eyes almost solidified as he spoke in a low voice, “No one has ever dared to treat me this way; you’ve got some guts!”

As he spoke, purple evil energy erupted from his body once again, this time appearing to be etched firmly onto Le Yu’s skin like a tattoo.

“Purple Qi Evil Body!” An onlooker from the Divine Roaming Realm exclaimed, “Is Le Yu about to use this technique?”

“The young master can’t suppress that evil energy any longer; quickly stop him!”

“It’s too late! Damn, who is that kid? How did he force the young master to use this move?” 

The group was in a panic, sweat pouring from their foreheads, helplessly hoping Le Yu would quickly resolve Yang Kai and disperse the purple evil energy.

The Purple Qi Evil Body was a martial skill born from the Malevolent Aura Cave. 

Martial artists who entered it absorbed the Malevolent Aura that permeated the cave for countless years, refining and assimilating it. If fortunate enough and talented enough, they may comprehend this martial skill.

Every year, many martial artists entered the Malevolent Aura Cave, hoping to grasp its mysteries; many entered but many also perished.

Occasionally, some lucky individuals would emerge alive, but that didn’t guarantee comprehension.

Le Yu was among the fortunate few! He would annually dedicate some time to the Malevolent Aura Cave to absorb the Malevolent Aura, thus enhancing the power of this martial skill.

Over the years, this martial skill had become incredibly potent.

Once the Purple Qi Evil Body was activated, Le Yu's strength surged, his eyes radiating a savage and mad look. He leapt from the ground, grinning savagely as he charged at Yang Kai. As he moved, a wolf-toothed club appeared in his hand, each spike sharp and unmatched, radiating a deep crimson light like thick blood.

This wolf-toothed club had clearly killed many people.

Le Yu was unleashing all his power!

Seeing this scene, everyone understood that he was evidently furious. That was why he used the Purple Qi Evil Body and activated his treasure. He had no intention of holding back.

“Yang Kai, be careful! He has lost his reason!” Bilo's face turned pale as she yelled at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai gave her a cold glance and snorted lightly.

Sensing the malevolent aura approaching, Yang Kai slowly retracted the True Yang Yuan Qi back into his Dantian.

The energy within his Proud Bone Golden Body erupted explosively.

Whoosh…

It was as if dark clouds covered the sky; a surge of darkness roiled, instantly swallowing all light. The spectators felt a sudden darkness enveloping them, as if they could see nothing.

Then, in the dark, two crimson eyes lit up, filled with madness and savagery, bloodthirsty and cruel, just like Le Yu's.

“What a dense killing intent!” The crowd gasped, astonished by Yang Kai's transformation, momentarily immobilized.

Which of these Divine Roaming Realm experts was not keenly aware? How could they not perceive that Yang Kai's killing intent surpassed Le Yu's by a significant margin?

“Could it be that he also comprehended his martial skill in the Malevolent Aura Cave? How could it appear so similar to Le Yu's?” 

Aside from the differing colors on their bodies, the other aspects bore little distinction.

“No, it’s not the same!” An expert from the Divine Roaming Realm spoke in amazement, “Look, although their gazes are similar, Le Yu has clearly lost most of his sanity; he’s nearly being devoured by the evil within him, moving only by instinct. Yet this young man… his gaze is remarkably steady.”

“Could it be he can suppress the evil within?” 

“Probably!” 

“Damn, what a freak!” The crowd exclaimed, while the several Divine Roaming Realm experts from Letian Pharmacy frowned heavily.

“You’re done for, hehehe!” Le Yu muttered, his icy and deranged eyes fixed on Yang Kai. Holding the wolf-toothed club, he slowly approached Yang Kai, and as he closed in, a violent pressure bore down on him.

Yang Kai flicked his hand, and the blood-red Shura Sword appeared in his grasp.

As the long sword trembled, a vast and overwhelming sword energy enveloped him instantaneously.

“A Heaven-Grade treasure!” The Divine Roaming Realm experts cried out in alarm once more.

Heaven-Grade treasures were rare, and even among them, very few possessed the class of Heaven-Grade treasure.

Moreover, this was a Heaven-Grade long sword treasure, worth even more than a typical treasure.

As the long sword appeared, the malevolent aura around the young man seemed to thicken once again, far surpassing what it had been earlier.

So young, yet so powerful, with a Heaven-Grade treasure to protect him, and a distinguished guest of the Enchantress Queen…

This… this kid is no simple character…

Realizing this fact, the Divine Roaming Realm experts from the Le family instantly broke out in cold sweat.

Could he possibly be a descendant of some evil king? If that were the case, provoking him like this would spell tremendous trouble for the Le family.

“Bilo, Miss Bilo!” An expert from the Le family quietly approached Bilo's side, cautiously whispering, “What exactly is this gentleman's identity?” 

With a face ashen, Bilo looked at Yang Kai, her enchanting visage devoid of color, and bitterly sighed, “I don’t know; he was brought back by the Queen. I’ve already said he is a distinguished guest of hers.”

“Do you have no idea at all?” This expert remained unconvinced, continuing to inquire.

Bilo slowly shook her head.

Boom, boom, boom…

While the two were conversing, Le Yu and Yang Kai had already engaged in combat. The Purple Qi Evil Body Le Yu wielded the enormous wolf-toothed club, and every strike seemed to hold the weight of countless forces, shattering Yang Kai's dark sword energies into pieces with ease.
