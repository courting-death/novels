## Chapter 55 — The Tea Is Good, But the Company Is Better

Why exactly had he come to find her? Although Hu Mei’er did not believe her sister’s words, a flicker of doubt still lingered in her heart.

Seeing the expression on her face, Hu Jiao’er let out a soft sigh. “Stubborn to the end, you will suffer great losses sooner or later.”

Hu Mei’er snapped irritably, “I’m not talking to you anymore. He must have something important to say; I’ll go ask him.”

She was about to rise, but her sister pressed her down with a hand. Hu Jiao’er’s eyes sparkled mischievously as she chuckled, “Little sister, how about a wager?”

“A wager on what?” Hu Mei’er asked, puzzled.

“On whether he is a hypocrite! If he truly is as you say, then he will remain unmoved in the face of temptation. But if he is not, then don’t blame your sister for being ruthless!” Hu Jiao’er’s eyes gleamed with a cold, dark light.

Over the years, Hu Mei’er had stirred up trouble outside, yet she had managed to keep her purity largely thanks to her sister. Those who harbored ill intentions toward Hu Mei’er and tried to force themselves on her always met with mysterious and untimely ends.

Hu Mei’er knew her sister’s methods all too well. Just by looking at her expression, she could tell that some dark scheme was afoot.

“Sister, what are you planning?” Hu Mei’er exclaimed.

“Just watch carefully,” Hu Jiao’er said with a wave of her delicate hand. A misty glow immediately enveloped her sister’s body, and gradually Hu Mei’er’s figure dimmed until she vanished completely.

“Sister, don’t do anything reckless!” Hu Mei’er pounded the air desperately, but no sound escaped. She could not step beyond the one zhang radius around her feet and was forced to watch everything inside the room with mounting anxiety.

Outside the door, Yang Kai waited for a long while, but Hu Mei’er did not come to open it. He sighed helplessly.

It seemed that he had truly offended her that day. Her anger was understandable; any woman would not calmly accept such words.

Forget it. Yang Kai had not held much hope anyway. He was only trying his luck. Now that she refused to acknowledge him, he would not force the matter.

Just as he was about to turn away, Hu Mei’er’s voice came from inside: “You may come in.”

Yang Kai was taken aback. After a moment’s hesitation, he pushed the door open and stepped inside.

Once inside and the door closed, all the noise outside vanished, leaving only serene silence.

Yang Kai looked around. The wooden cabin was about the same size as the one Su Yan stayed in, but the furnishings here were far more refined. Su Yan’s room was bare, a simple wooden hut, reflecting her own aloofness.

Here, however, there was a table, two chairs, and even a fragrant bed draped with pink curtains as thin as cicada wings. A small, delicate pillow rested on the bed, and the air was filled with a gentle feminine fragrance.

This place and Su Yan’s were worlds apart.

Hu Jiao’er sat at the table, her smile radiant and enchanting. She faced Yang Kai directly, her eyes shimmering with a strange intensity, a faint, inscrutable smile playing on her lips. Rosy blushes adorned her cheeks, making her all the more captivating.

Her slender arms were bare, the skin as smooth and translucent as a baby’s. She wore a pair of wooden clogs, revealing small, exquisite toes painted a deep purple-red, exuding a wild and alluring charm.

Yang Kai’s heart skipped a beat. For some reason, Hu Mei’er seemed especially enchanting today, far more alluring than when he had last seen her.

Yet her smile made him uneasy, as if she were mocking him.

At this moment, Hu Jiao’er held a slender, round cloth fan in one graceful hand, fanning herself with elegant poise. Strands of her fine hair fluttered in the breeze, adding a lazy nobility to her demeanor.

The fan’s surface was embroidered with the image of a courtesan—voluptuous and seductive, posed provocatively. If the embroidery were any less modest, it would border on scandalous.

Yang Kai glanced at it and thought, This woman is truly bold. Any other woman would be mortified to display such a thing, yet she wields it so casually. She is no ordinary person.

But… how had Hu Mei’er changed so much in just over half a month?

Though she stared unblinkingly at him, Yang Kai showed no sign of retreat. He walked toward her, meeting her gaze steadily. He had witnessed her embarrassing moment that day and held it like a secret weapon. Facing her now, he felt no fear.

Under his unwavering gaze, Hu Jiao’er—disguised as Hu Mei’er—felt slightly overwhelmed. She thought, This man is truly audacious. Who dares to hold such eye contact with a beauty? He should know better and look away, but he simply does not understand the ways of the world.

Still… his eyes were clear, without a hint of lust.

Approaching the table, Yang Kai cupped his fists. “Miss Mei’er, it has been over ten days since we last met. You grow ever more enchanting.”

Hu Jiao’er giggled, “You know how to flatter, do you?”

Hu Mei’er had told her everything about Yang Kai, so Hu Jiao’er knew exactly how to respond and had no fear of slipping up.

Yang Kai smiled. “I speak only the truth.”

He then sat down opposite her without ceremony, feeling a weight lift from his heart. It seemed she was not angry with him, which made things much easier.

“Miss Mei’er, I came this time to…” Yang Kai intended to speak plainly of his purpose, hoping to show sincerity.

“Not so fast,” Hu Jiao’er interrupted, setting down her fan and rising gracefully. She picked up the teapot from the table and poured a cup of tea for him. “It’s hot outside. Drink some tea to soothe your throat. Rest a while before speaking.”

“Very well,” Yang Kai nodded, accepting the warmth. He raised the cup and took a sip, but his expression suddenly shifted.

Hu Jiao’er returned to her seat, resting her hands on her fragrant cheeks, watching him leisurely. “Brother Yang, how do you find this tea?”

Yang Kai, distracted by other thoughts, lifted his eyes and gave her a meaningful glance before replying, “The leaves are flat and broad like palms, slender and upright. Their color is a verdant green, like dripping jade. The brewed leaves are full and fragrant—truly a fine quality.”

Hu Jiao’er blinked in surprise, staring at him. “You understand tea?”

Even she did not know much about it; she simply drank it. She could not help but be amazed that Yang Kai spoke so knowledgeably.

Yang Kai shook his head. “I know a little, but I am no expert.”

“Then how do you compare this tea to me?” Hu Jiao’er asked, her breath sweet as orchid. Even across the table, Yang Kai could feel the gentle, intoxicating scent she exhaled—like a mountain spring, pure and lingering like aged wine.

Without reason, Yang Kai suddenly found his breathing quicken and his blood stir. He blurted, “The tea is good, but the company is better.”

Hu Jiao’er laughed, her laughter bright and carefree, her chest rising and falling with the motion.

Yang Kai’s eyes were drawn to her ample bosom, and his Adam’s apple moved involuntarily.

Hu Jiao’er deliberately lifted her fan to shield her blossoming curves, but turned the fan’s embroidered courtesan toward him. Yang Kai’s face flushed deeply.
