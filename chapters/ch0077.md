## Chapter 77 — Release the Prisoner

“Sacrifice Yang Kai to save Su Yan, and you think your actions are justified?” Shopkeeper Meng let out a light, mocking laugh.

Su Xuanwu’s face turned awkward; he had thought the other was here to reprimand him.

Meng Wuya said, “Indeed, this way Su Yan will be safe… but if she learns of it afterward, what will she think?”

Su Xuanwu’s expression froze, and sweat suddenly poured down his forehead. He realized the gravity of the problem.

“If you truly do this, you will only create a tormenting shadow in Su Yan’s heart! She cultivates the Ice Heart Technique; once the heart demon is born, you know better than anyone the consequences,” Meng Wuya’s calm voice whispered in Su Xuanwu’s ear, striking him like thunder. Regret overwhelmed him.

He had only focused on the immediate benefit, never considering the dire consequences it would bring to Su Yan in the future. Indeed, sacrificing Yang Kai could ensure Su Yan’s safety this time, but as long as she lived, she would remember this event and believe her survival was solely due to Yang Kai’s sacrifice. Over time, her heart would be torn apart, her mind unsettled—how could her strength and realm possibly improve?

“Thank you, Shopkeeper Meng, for enlightening me,” Su Xuanwu said respectfully.

“Heh,” Meng Wuya chuckled lightly. “Even if I hadn’t spoken, you would have realized it eventually—just a little later.”

The Great Elder’s face darkened beside them. After finally catching Second Junior Brother off guard and gaining the upper hand, the matter was nearly settled. Now, Shopkeeper Meng appeared to lecture them, and Second Junior Brother would no longer accept being manipulated. For Su Yan’s future, he would not compromise this time.

Realizing this, Wei Xitong’s expression turned grim. “Shopkeeper Meng, this is the Elder Hall of Lingxiao Pavilion. Without the elders’ permission, no one may enter. You should return from whence you came.”

Meng Wuya glanced at him, casually tossed back the Elder’s Order, and with a flash, appeared in the central seat at the very top of the Elder Hall.

“How dare you!” Wei Xitong exploded in anger. The other elders also glared fiercely, their faces grim.

The reason was clear: that vacant seat was reserved for the Sect Leader of Lingxiao Pavilion. No one else had the right to occupy it. After years of open and covert struggles among the elders, even the Great Elder dared not covet that position.

Yet now, an unknown Shopkeeper from the Contribution Hall had taken the seat. How could the elders not be enraged? This was a blatant insult to the entire Lingxiao Pavilion!

“Heh, elders, please calm yourselves,” Meng Wuya said with a faint smile, stroking his beard. “I come on behalf of your Sect Leader, to deliver but a single message.”

“On behalf of the Sect Leader?” The five elders all showed surprise.

In these past ten years, even the five great elders found it nearly impossible to meet the Sect Leader. Yet here was Meng Wuya, claiming to have done so. And from his words, it seemed the Sect Leader had something to say about today’s matter.

What was going on? Even when chaos erupted within the pavilion, the Sect Leader never intervened. Why would such a trivial dispute among juniors now disturb him?

“What is this? You recognize it, don’t you?” Meng Wuya held up a purple jade pendant.

“The Sect Leader’s Jade Pendant!”

This jade pendant was the unmistakable symbol of the Lingxiao Sect Leader, impossible to forge.

“Good that you know,” Meng Wuya smiled faintly.

Wei Xitong cautiously asked, “May I ask, Shopkeeper Meng, what instructions has the Sect Leader passed down?”

Though the Sect Leader had not managed the pavilion’s affairs for over a decade, his authority remained unchallenged.

Meng Wuya said, “Your Sect Leader said: ‘Let great matters be reduced to small, small matters be resolved; harmony above all! What are you elders meddling in the disputes of juniors? Such shamelessness!’”

Wei Xitong’s face showed shock, stammering, “The Sect Leader… said this?”

“Oh, the latter part was my own addition. Your Sect Leader only said the first half,” Meng Wuya said calmly.

The five elders nearly choked with rage. Such a scolding was truly biting! Yet none dared retort.

“Furthermore, since Yang Kai has already attained the Open Origin Realm, let him be promoted to an ordinary disciple. It is improper for him to remain a trial disciple.”

“Is that… also your own words?” Wei Xitong asked hesitantly.

“Your Sect Leader said it,” Meng Wuya chuckled. “The message has been delivered. You may act accordingly.”

With that, he stepped down and strode out of the Elder Hall.

The five elders exchanged glances, falling silent. The Sect Leader had already spoken; what was there left to discuss? This was no great matter—everyone had merely been exaggerating. Resolving it would be effortless.

Su Xuanwu snorted coldly, swept his sleeves, and left. With the Sect Leader’s order, he no longer needed to contend. He went downstairs, grabbed Su Mu, and quickly vanished.

The Second Elder left, and the Third Elder He Beishui also took his leave, leaving only the Great Elder’s faction in the hall.

Fifth Elder You Zidai said, “Senior Brother, something feels off. This matter is minor, yet it has stirred the Sect Leader. Could there be some hidden meaning?”

Fourth Elder nodded in agreement, “Perhaps the Sect Leader wants to remind us he is still watching over Lingxiao Pavilion.”

This was also the Great Elder’s suspicion, though he dared not admit it. Now that Fourth Elder voiced it, a chill ran through his heart.

“No matter what, we must yield this time and be more cautious in the future,” the Great Elder mused. “However, we can test the Sect Leader’s intentions. If he wishes to return and govern the pavilion, we shall assist him. But if this is merely a whim… Lingxiao Pavilion cannot continue like this. It needs a true leader.”

“Indeed! But how shall we test him?” Fourth Elder asked softly.

“The Sect Leader said to promote Yang Kai to ordinary disciple, yes? Therein lies an opportunity.”

“I see!” Fourth and Fifth Elders suddenly understood.

Before the Forest Prison, Su Yan and Jie Hongchen’s group remained locked in a standoff. No one dared make a move.

This tense situation had lasted for half an hour. The chill around Su Yan grew ever stronger. Were it not for Yang Kai’s technique countering Su Yan’s Ice Heart Technique, she would have long been frozen solid.

During this stalemate, a disciple from the Law Enforcement Hall hurried over, shouting loudly, “The elders have issued an order: release the prisoner!”

“What?” Jie Hongchen was stunned.

The disciple’s face was grim. “Senior Brother Jie, the elders have decreed that today’s matter ends here. No one may pursue it further, or face sect punishment!”

Jie Hongchen glared venomously at Yang Kai. He had been hoping Su Yan would make a move, so he could find an opportunity to eliminate Yang Kai. But Su Yan had not given him that chance. Now, hearing the elders’ order, he knew all hope was lost.

Biting his teeth in fury, Jie Hongchen roared, “Release him!”

Su Yan still supported Yang Kai, leading Li Yuntian and the others forward slowly, her expression calm and unreadable. Under Jie Hongchen’s complicated gaze, they gradually departed.
