## Chapter 140 — Yin-Yang Demon Ginseng

“Battle?” Yang Kai’s heart stirred. “Please elaborate.”

“Yes.”

Through Di Mo’s narration, Yang Kai gradually understood some matters.

Di Mo remembered little, only scattered fragments of memory, but pieced together, it seemed he had been unwittingly drawn into a great battle years ago. Countless people had besieged two enemies, a man and a woman. In the end, nearly the entire army was wiped out, and the man and woman had perished on the spot.

“The old servant was heavily injured and fled, ultimately dying here. I remember…” Di Mo’s voice was hesitant, tinged with fear.
	
“Remember what?”

“There was a dragon, and a phoenix. The dragon and phoenix combined, destroying heaven and earth… The old servant was severely wounded by that move.”

Yang Kai’s eyes brightened; he recalled the dragon-shaped phoenix seal that had spiraled in the sky when the Inheritance Celestial Cave opened some days ago.

After speaking these words, Di Mo seemed greatly shaken, unable to recall anything more.

“If what you say is true, then this place is not your inheritance?” Yang Kai inquired.

“Please do not be angry, Young Master. The old servant was merely speaking casually. However, there is an inheritance here; if the Young Master desires it, the old servant will certainly impart it.”

“No need, I have no interest in your things.” Yang Kai quickly shook his head.

Di Mo felt greatly disheartened. Although he could not remember his true identity, he presumed he had been a remarkable figure in life, likely sought after by countless individuals wishing to become his disciples. Yet here, in front of Yang Kai, he was dismissed without a second thought.

Alas, a fallen phoenix is not as good as a chicken, Di Mo sighed inwardly.

The pearl was also useless; previously, Di Mo had inhabited it, and it was fine as long as it was untouched, but upon contact, it had turned to dust.

After turning around and finding nothing more, Yang Kai sighed deeply, deciding to leave this place.

He had stayed here for quite some time, and he had no idea what the situation outside was like. Since this was the Inheritance Celestial Cave, he might as well take a chance.

Arriving at the stone door that sealed this place, he opened it using the method taught by Di Mo. Before Yang Kai could step outside, a flash of red and white light suddenly rushed towards him.

Yang Kai’s expression changed, thinking he was being ambushed, and he hastily threw a punch.

To his surprise, the light seemed to possess some intelligence, evading Yang Kai’s strike and flying around his arm.

Yang Kai quickly retreated, while his other hand shot out to grab at the light.

He managed to grasp something tangible, and his expression turned peculiar.

He discovered that it was not an attack but rather a ginseng that had taken on a human-like form. This ginseng was strange in appearance, one side bright red and the other side snowy white, each color occupying half. Yang Kai could feel that this ginseng contained two completely different energies.

The red side harbored heat, while the white side was cold, the conflicting properties perfectly fused together, forming this peculiar spiritual object of heaven and earth.

At this moment, it was held tightly in Yang Kai’s hand, its formed features twisted, yet it could not escape his grasp.

“Yin-Yang Demon Ginseng!” Di Mo’s exclamation rang out.

“You recognize it?” Yang Kai asked.

“A rare treasure! This is a top-tier Mystery-Grade treasure!” Di Mo seemed to have discovered something extraordinary, exclaiming in surprise.

Before Yang Kai could inquire further, a sound of footsteps suddenly came from the other end of the cave.

“Someone is coming!” Yang Kai’s expression tightened, and he quickly tucked the Yin-Yang Demon Ginseng into his bosom.

Strangely enough, after being hidden away, the Yin-Yang Demon Ginseng ceased its struggles and remained still.

Just as Yang Kai was on guard, trying to discern who was approaching, a familiar voice came from the direction: “Sister, did it really run this way?”

Another voice replied, “Yes, it just darted inside here. This cave is quite concealed; had we not chased it in, we probably wouldn’t have found this place.”

The voices of the two were quite similar, both carrying a soft and delicate tone, like a spring breeze, refreshing to the ears.

Yang Kai frowned; he recognized who these two were, but he never expected to encounter them here.

“There are so many strange flowers and herbs here.”

“Indeed, this is quite an unexpected harvest. Let’s not rush to collect them; let’s check inside first.”

As they spoke, the two approached closer. Yang Kai did not hide; firstly, he knew them, and secondly, there was nowhere to conceal himself.

Before long, the two women arrived within several zhang of Yang Kai. Upon seeing someone blocking their path, one of them halted and called out, “Who’s there?”

Yang Kai cleared his throat and chuckled lightly, “Ladies, it’s been a while.”

Hearing his voice, one of them gasped lightly, while the other stepped forward, widening her eyes in surprise, “Yang Kai?”

“Mei’er!” Yang Kai nodded slightly at her, then turned to the other, “Jiao’er, it’s been a long time.”

These two were none other than the enchanting sisters of the Blood Battle Gang, Hu Jiao’er and Hu Mei’er.

Seeing Yang Kai recognize them at a glance, Hu Jiao’er glared, “You little brat!”

The last time they met, Yang Kai had remarked on the unevenness of her backside, and Hu Jiao’er had held a grudge about it until now.

In contrast to her sister, Hu Mei’er appeared much more delighted, “What are you doing here?”

“I stumbled upon this place.” Yang Kai did not elaborate further.

As they conversed, the sisters walked closer.

Hu Jiao’er shot a cold glare at Yang Kai, puffing her chest and drawing in her abdomen, raising her rounded backside high.

Di Mo’s voice echoed within Yang Kai, “There are actually two girls in the world who resemble each other so closely. What’s more, they are not even twins. Young Master, if you were to use their bodies to cultivate Falling Crimson Blossom, it would surely yield twice the result with half the effort, and you would achieve great success in no time.”

“Shut up!” Yang Kai sent a thought back.

Di Mo quickly fell silent.

“Have you seen anything come this way?” Hu Mei’er asked.

From their earlier conversation, Yang Kai understood that they had likely followed the Yin-Yang Demon Ginseng here. He did not hide it and nodded, “Yes.”

“Where is it?” Hu Jiao’er asked anxiously.

Yang Kai pointed to his chest.

The sisters blinked in unison, and Hu Jiao’er exclaimed, “You’ve collected it?”

“Yes, but I don’t know why it’s very quiet when it’s in my bosom.”

Hu Jiao’er took a deep breath, her ample chest rising and falling, nearly exasperated.

After chasing that peculiar treasure for several mountain peaks, they had finally seen it dart into a cave, only to find Yang Kai had gotten there first.

Why is it that every time I run into him, it’s nothing but trouble? Hu Jiao’er bit her lip. With her strength, if she really wanted to, she could snatch that thing away.

But Hu Jiao’er did not wish to do so; she knew her sister felt some guilt towards this little brat, though she did not know what had transpired between them. If they were to forcefully snatch it, her sister would surely intervene.

“It’s fine that you collected it.” Hu Mei’er surprisingly seemed unconcerned, feeling somewhat relieved.

What’s so good about this little brat? Hu Jiao’er scrutinized Yang Kai, and suddenly her expression shifted, “You’ve reached the seventh layer of the Open Origin Realm?”

Hu Jiao’er was shocked, utterly astonished. The last time they met, Yang Kai had only been in the Body Tempering Realm, and now it had only been a short time, yet he had reached the seventh layer of the Open Origin Realm? Unless he had some fortuitous encounter here, his cultivation speed was simply too fast.

It should be noted that her sister’s strength had been similar to his at that time, but now her sister was only at the second layer of the Open Origin Realm.

“Compared to Jiao’er, what’s the seventh layer of the Open Origin Realm?” Yang Kai was surprised at the sisters’ generosity. A treasure of heaven and earth is not something one simply stumbles upon, yet he had not expected them to not demand it from him.

“Hmph.” Hu Jiao’er clearly did not think highly of Yang Kai.

“There are some strange flowers and herbs outside. If you two don’t mind, feel free to collect some.” Yang Kai did not wish to owe them a favor. The Yin-Yang Demon Ginseng was a treasure of heaven and earth; in terms of value, it should far exceed the strange flowers and herbs outside. He could keep the Yin-Yang Demon Ginseng he had collected and compensate them with the strange flowers and herbs outside.

“Do I need you to tell me that?” Hu Jiao’er shot him a glare.

“Sister!” Hu Mei’er noticed her sister’s attitude towards Yang Kai and gently shook her arm.

“Alright, alright.” Hu Jiao’er relented, peering into the cave behind Yang Kai. She said, “Let’s not rush to collect those things. We’ve been running for several days; we need to find a place to recover. You help keep watch for a while.”

“Feel free.” Yang Kai stepped aside.

Hu Jiao’er and Hu Mei’er entered the cave together, the latter giving Yang Kai a slight smile, her sweet smile tinged with a hint of apology.

Once inside the cave, the sisters looked around, surprised by Di Mo’s withered bones, but soon their gazes fixed on a rock wall to the left.

Their beautiful eyes grew serious in an instant, staring intently.

Yang Kai, puzzled, followed their gaze to the rock wall but found nothing.

“What are you looking at?” After observing for a while, Yang Kai grew curious; the rock wall had no inscriptions or flowers, so why were they so focused?

Neither of them responded, as if their minds were wholly immersed in the rock wall.

Yang Kai furrowed his brow, unsure of what was happening. He had been here for many days, and that rock wall truly seemed unremarkable.

After waiting for a while, the two sisters suddenly sat cross-legged, closing their eyes and entering a meditative state.

Vaguely, Yang Kai felt that at this moment, they were merging into one, almost becoming a single entity, yet upon closer inspection, they were still two.

This sudden discovery shook Yang Kai.

“There must be some opportunity for them here,” Di Mo’s voice resounded.

“Is there something remarkable about that rock wall?”

“Certainly, but neither the Young Master nor I can see it. Only those who have the opportunity can glimpse a thing or two.”

“So, it’s not your inheritance?” Yang Kai frowned.

“Of course not.”

This matter was strange, but since the two had made a discovery, Yang Kai naturally could not leave easily. After all, they shared some rapport, and he stood quietly at the entrance, waiting.
