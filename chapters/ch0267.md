## Chapter 267 — Yao Wang Valley

With doubts in his heart, Yang Kai turned to look at the girl.

Since she was swept away by his kick and fell to the ground, she had not stood up, her face filled with panic and lingering fear, as if she had suffered a great shock, her delicate body trembling uncontrollably.

Just a moment ago, she had been on the brink of death; the sharp long sword had even severed several strands of her hair, and there was a crimson mark on her neck. At this moment, she was covering her fair neck with her hand, drenched in fragrant sweat.

Seeing Yang Kai looking at her, the girl couldn't help but feel a jolt in her heart, her expression fearful.

Only now did she realize what kind of existence she had provoked. In less than thirty breaths, he had taken the lives of seven or eight people; describing him as someone who kills without hesitation was not an exaggeration.

Yang Kai frowned and walked closer, squatting down in front of her.

The girl kept retreating, her long eyelashes trembling incessantly, terrified to the extreme.

With a light laugh, Yang Kai pushed aside her hand and examined the wound on her neck, saying, "It's just an external injury. If you take care of it, there won't even be a mark left."

As he spoke, he reached into his bosom and took out a Healing Pill, handing it to her.

The girl forced a smile, "I have pills..."

Her vigilance was quite strong, but Yang Kai didn't mind and put away his pill. The girl continued to look at him timidly, and seeing that he seemed to have no malicious intent, she mustered the courage to take out a bottle and swallowed a pill.

"You should have leaned back when you were restrained just now, didn't you know?" Yang Kai frowned.

"I... I've never fought before..." The girl blushed a little. Although she had been cultivating since childhood, she had only sparred with friends and had never experienced life-and-death battles. When someone had pointed a long sword at her, she had been completely at a loss.

Yang Kai carefully observed her and found that this girl had delicate skin and was dressed quite luxuriously. Although she appeared a bit quirky, she still possessed a unique aura that could not be cultivated by ordinary small forces.

She must be a young lady from a prominent family! No wonder she looked about the same age as him but had reached the peak of the Separation and Union Realm, yet her combat experience was so lacking.

The result of being pampered.

"How did you provoke that group of people?"

"How would I know?" The girl immediately felt aggrieved. "I was... cough... I was out playing when that group suddenly appeared. If I hadn't run fast, I would have been caught by them. They were all so ugly, it scared me to death."

Yang Kai couldn't help but smile slightly.

Seeing that he seemed easy to talk to, the girl's courage grew significantly. With her almond-shaped eyes wide open, she glared at Yang Kai, "And you! Why did you throw me back? Do you know how dangerous it was just now? If I had really died, I would haunt you as a ghost, following you every day until you were annoyed!"

Yang Kai looked into the distance, his gaze deep, and after a moment, he withdrew his gaze and said solemnly, "Perhaps your shout was unintentional, but what if it had been someone else without much strength? If they had bad luck, they might have been immediately cut to pieces by random swords."

The girl was taken aback, her eyes flickering as she lowered her head and whispered, "I was wrong..."

	After saying that, she raised her head again, aggrieved, "But you too were heartless, right? People say that one should help when seeing injustice on the road. With your strength, even if I used you a little, it wouldn't matter."

Yang Kai chuckled lightly and did not explain.

When those big men surrounded the girl earlier, the lustful glint in their eyes was something Yang Kai had naturally seen. He had planned to wait for them to leave before secretly following to see the situation, but unexpectedly, those people were unwilling to let him go as well. It suited his intentions perfectly, killing them would resolve everything.

Standing up, he ignored the girl's shouts and questions, unleashing his movement technique as he headed towards Yao Wang Valley.

The girl was momentarily stunned but quickly stood up to follow him. They were only a few li away from Yao Wang Valley, and she was deeply afraid that more villains would suddenly appear, so she was eager to enter Yao Wang Valley for safety.

Chasing after Yang Kai's figure, once they entered the valley town, she could no longer find him.

"He's not much older than me, yet so strong. Which family does he belong to?" The girl murmured softly, pondering for a while but failing to recall anyone fitting that description, feeling a wave of frustration.

Upon entering the valley town, the various medicinal aromas greeted them, making one feel refreshed. Yang Kai casually wandered around the town and discovered that the shops here, aside from inns and restaurants, were all related to herbs and pills.

Common or uncommon spiritual herbs, rare fruits, and miraculous medicines were all available, with all sorts of medicinal materials displayed in the shops. There were even many he had never heard of before, all of which were abundant and dazzling.

No wonder it was Yao Wang Valley! Yang Kai silently praised.

In such a scene, any alchemist arriving here would likely be unwilling to leave. Alchemists had a special fondness and love for medicinal materials, and with so many alluring herbs present, it would be strange if they wanted to leave.

In every shop, many martial artists were stopping to observe or bargaining with the shopkeepers to purchase medicinal materials.

Moreover, many alchemists were conducting business, helping martial artists refine pills.

However, the alchemists in the town of Yao Wang Valley were all disciples of Yao Wang Valley! Most martial artists who came here to seek help in refining pills were drawn by the reputation of Yao Wang Valley, naturally not seeking other forces' alchemists.

Yang Kai wandered for a long time, admiring and observing along the way, and found that these alchemists were also ranked.

Corresponding to the levels of heaven-and-earth treasures, they were divided into Common-Grade, Earth-Grade, Heaven-Grade, and Mystery-Grade, with each level further divided into upper, middle, and lower grades.

Most of those he saw were around Earth-Grade, like the one sitting in the shop before him, who had a silver two-petal flower embroidered on his chest, indicating he was a middle-level Earth-Grade alchemist, meaning he could proficiently refine middle-level Earth-Grade pills.

One petal of the flower corresponded to one level: gold, silver, and white representing upper, middle, and lower grades. Through the embroidery on these alchemists' clothing, one could easily see their level.

Alchemists above Heaven-Grade were rare, and those of Mystery-Grade were even less seen.

The elders of Yao Wang Valley were the Mystery-Grade alchemists.

Many shops had finished pills for sale. Yang Kai had no interest in ordinary pills, but the nourishing pills for the soul captivated him.

These pills not only could strengthen his newly cultivated Divine Sense but also nourish the Warm Spirit Lotus, allowing the Five-Colored Warm Spirit Lotus to advance towards its ultimate goal of becoming Seven-Colored.

Once the Warm Spirit Lotus evolved to the Seven-Colored level, its effects would be tremendous.

However, nourishing pills were scarce and much more expensive than ordinary pills.

A bottle of ordinary lower-level Earth-Grade pills, containing ten pills, was priced at five thousand taels.

Yet a bottle of lower-level Earth-Grade nourishing pills would cost at least thirty thousand taels, a full six times more expensive!

Yang Kai, feeling financially strained, could only sigh in disappointment.

After wandering for a long time and seeing that the sky was about to darken, Yang Kai decided to find an inn to stay.

At night, the town of Yao Wang Valley was even more bustling. Yang Kai casually ate something before stepping out of the inn to gather information.

He had come to Yao Wang Valley to see the Wan Yao Pool, but the Wan Yao Pool was a forbidden area of Yao Wang Valley, and entering it was likely not an easy task.

After several days of probing around Yao Wang Valley, Yang Kai had found no leads and felt increasingly anxious.

The Wan Yao Pool of Yao Wang Valley was located atop the main peak, Dan Sheng Peak. Not only was there the Wan Yao Pool, but there was also the portrait of Dan Sheng beside the pool, a sacred place in the hearts of all alchemists. It was usually heavily guarded, and even ordinary disciples of Yao Wang Valley could not approach it; only the valley master and elders had the qualifications to comprehend the alchemical mysteries left behind in Dan Sheng's portrait.

Yang Kai had heard many rumors about Dan Sheng's portrait, all of which were fantastical. It was said that Dan Sheng's spirit would occasionally appear to resolve the confusions in alchemists' hearts and even teach alchemical techniques, benefiting many.

Because of this, Yao Wang Valley took extreme care in protecting the Wan Yao Pool.

With such tight defenses, how could one approach it?

The Wan Yao Pool was different from the forbidden area of Lingxiao Pavilion, the Dragon Confinement Ravine. Although the Dragon Confinement Ravine was a forbidden area, it stretched long and was extremely dangerous, so naturally, no one would dare to approach.

One day, while Yang Kai was wandering in the city without a lead, he suddenly caught sight of a familiar figure flashing by.

Looking at the person's back, Yang Kai couldn't help but chuckle.

Quietly following this person, it wasn't long before he saw them enter a shop.

Yang Kai looked up and saw the sign hanging above the shop reading "Dong Family Pharmacy."

He walked directly into the pharmacy, and immediately a shop assistant came out to greet him enthusiastically, "What would the guest like? Our Dong Family Pharmacy has a rich variety of medicinal materials, whether for refining pills or finished pills, all are for sale at fair prices, honest to both young and old. If the guest is interested, please take a look."

"I’m not here to buy anything," Yang Kai shook his head.

"Then..."

"I’m looking for the young man who just went in!" Yang Kai said.

The shop assistant's expression immediately grew wary as he scanned Yang Kai from head to toe. He didn't get angry but cautiously asked, "May I ask how to address you, young sir?"

Yang Kai smiled slightly, "Just tell him that an old friend from Lingxiao Pavilion has come to visit!"

The shop assistant was taken aback and nodded slightly.

He turned and went into the inner hall to report. Not long after, the shop assistant came back out, his face full of smiles, slightly obsequious, "Young sir, please follow me. My young master is waiting for you!"

Yang Kai nodded.

Entering the inner hall, he followed the stairs all the way up to the third floor. When they reached the door, the shop assistant respectfully said, "The young master is inside!"

After saying that, he respectfully withdrew.

Yang Kai pushed open the door and strode in.

At a glance, he saw a slightly plump face smiling at him.

Dong Family, Dong Qinghan!

Behind him were the Wind and Cloud Twin Guardians of the Dong Family, two elderly men who appeared frail but whose eyes concealed sharpness. They merely nodded slightly at Yang Kai.

Beside him sat a dignified and beautiful young girl, pouting as she held a cup of tea. When Yang Kai's gaze swept over, their eyes met, and they were both stunned.

The girl was equally astonished, her expression extremely vivid, her eyes wide open as she stared blankly at Yang Kai, causing the tea she had just sipped to spray out uncontrollably, splattering Dong Qinghan's face.
