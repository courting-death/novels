## Chapter 288 — Dual Cultivation Technique Second-Tier

A few days later, at the place where Ling Taixu was in closed-door cultivation.

Master smiled as he looked at Yang Kai, his gaze filled with profound meaning. After a long while, he finally spoke, “I won’t ask what kind of medicine you used on me, nor will I inquire where it came from. You must remember, my ability to come back from the dead this time is solely due to my own unfulfilled wishes; it has nothing to do with you!”

Yang Kai nodded gravely, “I understand the gravity of the situation!”

At first glance, Ling Taixu's words seemed somewhat unfeeling, but how could Yang Kai not know that he was trying to protect him?

A miraculous medicine that could bring someone back to life was of great importance. An innocent man could suffer for having a precious gem, so how could Ling Taixu allow Yang Kai to take risks?

“Master, this is your Spatial Pouch!” Yang Kai took out the Spatial Pouch from his bosom and handed it over.

However, Ling Taixu did not accept it, merely smiling as he said, “Things given by Master should not be taken back.”

Yang Kai chuckled lightly, “I have no use for it now.”

The storage space of the Wordless Black Book had already been opened, and the Spatial Pouch was indeed no longer of any use.

Ling Taixu shook his head slowly, “Keep it for yourself. If you truly feel you have no use for it, you can give it to someone else. Master thinks this item would make a nice token of affection.”

Yang Kai gave a sheepish smile, and without insisting, he put the Spatial Pouch back into his bosom.

Furrowing his brow, Yang Kai asked, “How are your injuries…”

Ling Taixu smiled slightly, “No major issues. My strength has returned to its peak, and I might even be slightly beyond that…”

Yang Kai's expression brightened, feeling quite uplifted as he said, “But Master, the evil energy within you has yet to be completely dispelled…”

Ling Taixu frowned, seemingly deep in thought, “I find this quite strange. The things you gave me were quite marvelous. I feel that if I could completely expel the evil energy within me… I might ascend to the First Stage!”

Ling Taixu had already reached the pinnacle of the Divine Roaming Realm; ascending to the First Stage would mean surpassing the Divine Roaming!

Above the Divine Roaming, there were only one or two such experts in a typical first-rate sect, and even among those superpowers, there were not many.

If Ling Taixu could truly advance beyond the Divine Roaming, it would indeed be a blessing in disguise.

Could the Wan Yao Ling Paste help one comprehend martial arts? Yang Kai was unsure if it had such miraculous effects. However, it was indeed the essence of that well, so it likely had such powerful effects.

“Congratulations, Master!” Yang Kai sincerely felt happy. Ling Taixu had delayed for over a decade due to the matters concerning his two disciples. He could have reached this stage long ago, but it had been postponed until today.

Ling Taixu smiled slightly but shook his head slowly.

Yang Kai’s expression turned serious as he said, “Master, did your second disciple really come out of the Dragon Confinement Ravine?”

Upon hearing this, a fleeting shadow of sorrow crossed Ling Taixu's eyes. He sighed softly and nodded, “Yes. Back then, I crippled his cultivation and confined him in the Dragon Confinement Ravine, allowing him to fend for himself. I never expected that after more than a decade, he would still be able to emerge. It truly surprised me. As far as I know, he must have encountered some fortuitous events down there to restore his strength. Moreover, his power has greatly increased, and his evil technique has reached perfection!”

The formation of the Dragon Confinement Ravine was caused by the battle when the founding ancestor of the Lingxiao Pavilion killed a demon. After the demon was slain, it fell to the bottom of the ravine, leaving behind who knows what remnants that Ling Taixu's second disciple inadvertently obtained hundreds of years later.

That second disciple appeared to be a person blessed with fortune.

“He not only escaped but has also become the Evil Lord of the Cangyun Evil Land!”

“What!” Yang Kai was taken aback, “He is the Evil Lord?”

Ling Taixu frowned as he looked at Yang Kai, “Have you seen him?”

“I haven’t seen him, but not long ago, Yao Wang Valley suffered a major attack from the Cangyun Evil Land. It is said to be his doing!”

“How is the situation? Speak in detail!” Ling Taixu seemed unaware of the changes at Yao Wang Valley and quickly inquired.

This was not due to the Lingxiao Pavilion being closed off from information, but rather because Ling Taixu had been in a coma for over a month due to severe wounds, and the elders of the Lingxiao Pavilion had yet to report to him.

“On the last day of the alchemy conference, the Cangyun Evil Land launched a massive assault, taking many direct descendants of major powers hostage…” Yang Kai briefly recounted everything he knew.

Ling Taixu's expression grew increasingly grim as he listened. By the end, an ominous look appeared on his face.

“If that’s the case… he probably escaped from the Dragon Confinement Ravine half a year ago or even longer, but only attacked our Lingxiao Pavilion a little over a month ago…” His expression changed drastically, “This is not good!”

“What do you mean?” Yang Kai asked anxiously.

“If outsiders learn that the Evil Lord comes from our Lingxiao Pavilion…” Ling Taixu's face turned ashen.

The Lingxiao Pavilion was merely a second-rate sect. If the Evil Lord truly came from this place, it would surely bring unrest if those major powers found out!

Regardless of anything else, after the Evil Lord's return, Yao Wang Valley was attacked, and the relic of Dan Sheng was destroyed. This was a matter that shook the world.

“You should go see Su Yan. It has been over a year since you last met; you should have a good talk. I will be in closed-door cultivation for a few days.” Ling Taixu said solemnly, clearly contemplating how to resolve this calamity.

There is no wall that does not let the wind through; it wouldn’t be long before the origins of the Evil Lord would be investigated. By then, the Lingxiao Pavilion would surely face great trouble.

Exiting the Sect Leader's closed-door cultivation area, Yang Kai sighed deeply. In the face of this sect's calamity, his personal strength felt too insignificant.

He flew swiftly, and what he saw was that the entire Lingxiao Pavilion was in a state of despair. More and more disciples were leaving, and no one stopped them.

Arriving at Su Yan's small loft, Yang Kai leaped up.

Pushing the door open, he found Su Yan sitting cross-legged on the bed, practicing the Ice Heart Technique, unaffected by the changes outside.

Noticing Yang Kai's arrival, Su Yan slightly opened her eyes, and a hint of blush appeared on her cold and beautiful face, making her look charmingly shy.

Yang Kai stepped forward, suppressing the stirrings in his heart, and jumped onto the bed, sitting cross-legged before her.

Their gazes met; Yang Kai's eyes were filled with fiery desire, while Su Yan's eyes shimmered with water, seemingly holding infinite charm.

He wanted to undress the beauty before him, to savor her exquisite beauty, to feel that intoxicating taste, and to reach their peaks in indulgence. Yang Kai believed Su Yan would not refuse.

However… Yang Kai still felt a strange sensation in his heart.

The intimacy between them was entirely due to the Dual Cultivation Technique, not like the natural progression of feelings that developed over time, as with his little junior sister Xia Ningshang.

Their current relationship could be described as a meeting of minds, or, more bluntly, as nothing at all.

Every time Yang Kai returned, it was merely a few indulgent encounters with Su Yan. This feeling was not that of lovers entwined in longing.

It felt more like completing the task of cultivating the Dual Cultivation Technique!

This very feeling made Yang Kai somewhat uncomfortable.

The Yin-Yang Demon Ginseng had yet to show its effects, and it was precisely because this forced intimacy did not feel natural.

To truly unleash the power of the Yin-Yang Demon Ginseng, they could not maintain this state forever.

Although it was undeniable that the Dual Cultivation Technique was the fundamental reason for their feelings, Yang Kai did not want their bond to be solely tied together by the Dual Cultivation Technique.

A meeting of hearts… how many couples in the world could reach such a level? Even those old couples who had respected each other for decades might find it hard to achieve.

“What are you thinking about?” Su Yan looked at Yang Kai in surprise, noticing that the fervor in his eyes was rapidly fading, and his boiling blood was gradually calming down.

This was very different from his usual self. In the past, every time he saw her, he couldn’t help himself, always stripping off his clothes first, then taking off hers, and then…

“I want your body!” Yang Kai grinned, his demeanor calm.

Su Yan's fair neck turned slightly red. She softly replied, “It already belongs to you.”

“But I want your heart even more!”

Su Yan raised her head, looking at Yang Kai with suspicion, her eyes gradually revealing a hint of joy.

“You should know what I mean.” Yang Kai smiled gently.

Su Yan nodded lightly.

It was only today that Yang Kai understood what was lacking between him and Su Yan, but Su Yan had already seen through it long ago. She just hadn’t said anything. A woman is always at a disadvantage in front of a man, especially in front of the man she likes. Even if she knows his actions are somewhat inappropriate, even if she has her own thoughts, she wouldn’t lay it bare until he sees clearly.

This was the approach of a wise woman.

Only by letting him understand, by making him realize, would this man truly grow.

“Shall we work together?” Yang Kai tilted his head, smiling lightly.

Su Yan nodded slightly, her watery eyes shimmering with a misty haze.

She had been waiting for this moment for a long time.

Men and women are different; a woman always has a special feeling and dependence on her first man. After those numerous dual cultivations and endless waiting and longing, Su Yan was already willing to entrust her body and heart completely.

What was lacking between them was merely that flicker of enlightenment in Yang Kai's heart.

Now that Yang Kai finally understood, it naturally gave Su Yan hope.

Until this moment, the bond created by the Dual Cultivation Technique between them was completely severed, transforming into genuine feelings of love.

Even without the Dual Cultivation Technique, they would not easily let go of each other.

Perhaps not at this moment, perhaps in the distant future, one day they would reach the level of a meeting of hearts.

Sitting face to face, Yang Kai wore a radiant smile, extending his hands to rest on Su Yan's knees.

Su Yan slowly placed her hands in Yang Kai's palms.

Soft as if boneless, smooth and fragrant, pure and clean, Su Yan's small hands felt very comfortable to touch.

Gently holding them, they exchanged smiles and closed their eyes to cultivate the Dual Cultivation Technique.

Cultivating the Dual Cultivation Technique is divided into three stages. The first stage requires physical intimacy so that Yuan Qi can flow between the two. This is the initial stage, and it is also the most splendid one, as every cultivation session is filled with enchanting moments, creating a humid and warm atmosphere.

Just like Yang Kai's previous approach.

The second stage is the current state, where their hearts connect without needing to be as candid as before. Just a little contact is enough to operate the technique.

Yang Kai's flicker of enlightenment allowed them to enter this stage, making the operation of the Dual Cultivation Technique faster and more efficient than before.
