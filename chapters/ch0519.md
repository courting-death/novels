## Chapter 519 — Can You Kill Them?

Continuously, people rushed out from Yang Zhao's manor, standing at a distance confronting Yang Kai with hostile expressions. But upon seeing Di Mo guarding Yang Kai by his side, their faces filled with fear, and they dared not make any rash moves.

Di Mo's bloody and cruel methods that night had instilled an enormous deterrence in them.

Not long after Di Mo hurriedly arrived, Qiu Yimeng also appeared beside Yang Kai, leading a group from the manor.

Seeing Yang Kai’s current state, Miss Qiu was startled and quickly rushed over to ask, “Yang Kai, what are you doing?”

Huo Xingchen’s eyes trembled as well, feeling the violent aura radiating from Yang Kai, a fierce chill settling in his heart.

The crowd gathering also whispered among themselves, pointing at Yang Kai and discussing whether this youngest young master of the Yang Family had indeed reached the verge of entering the Enter Demonic State, about to lose his sanity and be controlled by evil.

If that were true, it would be an enormous joke.

The Zhongdu Eight Great Families and the Cangyun Evil Land had always been bitter enemies. The warriors of the Eight Great Families took it as their mission to eradicate evil demons. To have this promising new star of the Yang Family, who was expected to inherit the family headship, almost turning into a devil would surely become mere gossip among the world.

Tang Yuxian, the Hu sisters, Dong Qinghan, the four girls from Wan Hua Palace, Luo Xiaoman... one pair of concerned eyes after another looked over in worry.

“Are you still conscious?” Qiu Yimeng asked in a trembling voice, her beautiful eyes locked on Yang Kai’s, hoping to find a trace of humanity. Unfortunately, she was disappointed. Though his eyes were clear, they were filled only with killing intent, seemingly consumed by hatred and murderous intent, extinguishing his original nature.

Her heart trembled involuntarily, feeling lost. Though Qiu Yimeng had performed well during the succession battle and always acted as Yang Kai’s deputy, commanding many warriors in the manor, after all, she still regarded Yang Kai as the core. All actions and commands revolved around him.

If anything were to happen to Yang Kai, all her efforts would amount to nothing.

Yang Kai turned his head and looked at her, shaking his head: “It’s fine.”

Qiu Yimeng was stunned, scarcely able to believe that Yang Kai could still suppress the violent aura within and keep his mind clear in such a state.

Any other warrior might not be able to do so.

Di Mo scoffed beside him, sneering: “Young Master, your current aura suits this old servant’s appetite perfectly. Haha, it seems our master-servant pairing is truly destined!”

Qiu Yimeng couldn’t help but glare at him, then anxiously asked, “Since you’ve returned, why did you come here instead of inside the manor?”

“To kill.”

“To kill who?”

“Xiang Chu and Nan Sheng.”

Upon hearing this, everyone’s expressions changed dramatically.

Xiang Chu and Nan Sheng, though not as prestigious as the scions of the Zhongdu Eight Great Families, were still heirs to first-class noble houses. Such people were not to be slain lightly.

Even someone as detestable as Lü Song was spared by Yang Kai. Why would he want to kill Xiang Chu and Nan Sheng now?

Just as Qiu Yimeng began to relax, she suspected Yang Kai might have gone mad.

“Yang Kai, shall we go back first?” Qiu Yimeng stepped forward, grabbing Yang Kai’s arm, pleading softly, “Let’s go back and discuss it. Maybe we can find a better way to kill Nan Sheng and Xiang Chu without much effort, to help you clear your grievances.”

Yang Kai turned his head, looking at her strangely.

“I’m serious; blocking here won’t let you kill them. There are many warriors in Yang Zhao’s manor. Even if all of us charged in, we might not be able to kill them,” Qiu Yimeng continued, “Let’s go back first, okay?”

Huo Xingchen’s eyes widened.

He had never seen this tender side of Qiu Yimeng before. Miss Qiu was always intelligent and capable, giving off an air of sharpness that made people overlook her feminine side.

Such a woman, when gentle, was an irresistible temptation to any man.

Huo Xingchen was confident that if Qiu Yimeng treated him so tenderly, even his bones would melt, and he would obey whatever she said.

“Yeah, Yang Kai, let’s go back first. We can discuss together as long as it takes,” Luo Xiaoman said, suddenly emboldened to speak to Yang Kai.

The four girls from Wan Hua Palace, each with a distinct temperament, nodded in agreement, gently persuading Yang Kai.

Though their words varied, not a single one failed to overflow with softness and motherly warmth.

The others exchanged glances, their expressions growing strange.

Yang Kai frowned, scanning the crowd until his gaze landed on Qiu Yimeng’s face: “Do you treat me like a child?”

However, despite this, he felt warmth in his heart. After all, these people cared about his condition.

All the girls blushed, finally realizing his mind was indeed clear, with no sign of confusion.

Yang Kai let out a light laugh, a trace of gratitude and tenderness appearing on his face, speaking softly, “I really am fine. You don’t have to worry.”

Qiu Yimeng took a deep breath, her expression firming up, and after a moment’s thought said, “Alright, I’ll trust you really are fine. But how do you intend to kill Xiang Chu and Nan Sheng? This is Yang Zhao’s manor, housing nearly a thousand warriors, four to five times our number! Even if you manage to kill them, most of these people will perish with them. Are you willing to do that?”

“You overestimate them,” Yang Kai’s expression turned cold, slowly shaking his head. “Numbers don’t mean everything. Second Brother is cautious and careful; without complete confidence, he absolutely won’t start a fight with me.”

“He must consider Eldest Brother and his desire to win this succession war! Haha, I don’t hold back like that,” Yang Kai sneered.

Qiu Yimeng was stunned. She hadn’t expected Yang Kai to be not only unharmed but also thinking so clearly now.

One side could strike fully, while the other hesitated carefully—a development likely to go exactly as Yang Kai predicted.

Lost in thought, Qiu Yimeng saw Yang Zhao stride out from the manor, his face darkening. Standing outside under heavy guard, he coldly shouted, “Ninth Brother, what do you mean by this?”

Yang Zhao was furious beyond measure. Xiang Chu and Nan Sheng’s defeat deeply disappointed him. Though secretly surprised by Yang Kai’s formidable strength, having his men blocked outside his manor like this made him lose face.

And this was broad daylight. Although dark clouds gathered overhead, obscuring the sun, Ninth Brother’s actions were far too disrespectful.

“Second Brother,” Yang Kai nodded coolly at him, “Your methods are good. This time, Ninth Brother nearly messed up.”

Yang Zhao’s expression soured. He snorted coldly, “Stop mocking Second Brother. I underestimated your strength. If I had gone in myself this time, you wouldn’t be standing here talking to me.”

Yang Kai sneered contemptuously, “Even if Second Brother went in himself, it probably wouldn’t work!”

Yang Zhao’s face turned cold as stone, his voice low and grim: “Ninth Brother, Second Brother just realized that you are the most arrogant of the Yang family!”

After a pause, he shook his head slowly: “Ninth Brother, is it worth it just for a disciple of Lingxiao Pavilion? I've heard how it happened. Since you already had a prior arrangement with Kang Zhan, if the Xiang and Nan families interfered with them, that’s their fault and their deaths well deserved. But you killed quite a few people too. Your anger should have subsided by now, right? You blocking Second Brother’s gate—don’t you think that’s inappropriate? Or do you think Second Brother is easy to bully?”

His final words were a harsh rebuke.

With his challenge, the warriors around him quietly gathered their strength; the atmosphere suddenly tensed like a drawn sword.

Yang Kai’s expression remained calm as he coldly said, “Second Brother, I don’t want to argue with you this time. I only want to kill. Once I kill those two, I’ll leave immediately.”

“With me here, do you think you can?”

“Then there’s nothing more to say.” Yang Kai looked disappointed, slowly shaking his head. His gaze passed over Yang Zhao, landing on a certain spot behind him.

There, Xiang Chu and Nan Sheng had stealthily slipped out and were hiding within the crowd, watching outside.

Noticing Yang Kai’s gaze, their faces turned pale.

“Today, no matter who protects you, you will surely die!” Yang Kai suddenly displayed impatience, his voice cold and explosive as cruel chilling intent appeared in his eyes.

Crackling sounds came from the ground suddenly freezing. An unparalleled coldness descended, centering on Yang Kai. The ground in a fan-shaped area before him instantly turned into frozen earth.

Sensing the danger and killing intent concealed in the frost, the warriors gathered at Yang Zhao’s manor changed expression drastically, leaping high to evade the icy onslaught.

Unlike the True Yang Yuan Qi cultivated through True Yang Technique, the energy within the Proud Bone Golden Body was both wicked and cold, existing at the extreme opposite end.

Once Yang Kai unleashed this evil power, the surrounding temperature plummeted sharply.

Di Mo laughed wickedly, launching a blood-red light. The recently frozen ground was suddenly covered in this crimson glow. Within the thick, blood-like radiance, a figure appeared eerily.

It was the Blood Demon puppet forged by Di Mo. As long as this blood sea existed, it was immortal.

The Blood Demon silently stood atop the blood sea, motionless, exuding a furious murderous aura.

Tang Yuxian also shouted sharply, her vast Divine Sense power spreading out.

The warriors beside Yang Kai no longer hesitated, one after another drawing their Mystery-Grade Secret Treasures.

A furious roar sounded behind Yang Kai as a huge triangular head suddenly appeared—purely composed of black energy.

The triangular head shook, its slender eyes the size of copper bells radiating a terrifying chill.

No one dared move under that gaze!

Gradually, the creature revealed its fierce whole form, causing an outcry.

It was a jiao dragon as black as ink! Its body, several tens of zhang long, coiled above Yang Kai’s head, lifelike as if alive.

Xiang Chu and Nan Sheng nearly collapsed, their legs weakening when they saw the long-missed black jiao dragon.

Back on Taifang Mountain, it was with this black jiao dragon condensed from Yang Kai’s True Yuan that he had once effortlessly bitten through the body of a two-stage Divine Roaming Realm warrior.
