## Chapter 320 — This Matter Is Not Over

Le Yu was robust and strong, wielding a massive wolf fang club in hand, exuding a momentum that seemed unparalleled under heaven and earth. As he swung the wolf fang club, each strike covered a vast area.

Yang Kai's sword energy, numbering in the thousands, had not even had the chance to take effect before it was utterly destroyed.

His expression darkened, and Yang Kai flicked his wrist to unleash a sword, the True Essence coalescing into a pitch-black sword light that shot like a rainbow piercing the sun, directly aimed at Le Yu, almost cleaving the void in two.

Le Yu grinned savagely, not dodging or evading, and swung his wolf fang club down fiercely.

With a thunderous sound, the pitch-black sword light was shattered. Although Le Yu's body stumbled slightly from the shock, he was unharmed and continued to charge towards Yang Kai, resembling a frenzied beast.

Wrapped in an ominous black energy, Yang Kai's eyes glowed red, cold and sharp as knives.

Black aura swirled between his palms as he fiercely pushed forward.

White Tiger Seal, Divine Ox Seal.

Amidst the sounds of tiger roars and bovine moos, two enormous and pitch-black beast souls manifested. One bared its teeth and lunged at Le Yu, while the other barreled forward with overwhelming might.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

The earth trembled violently, and a frenzied look erupted in Le Yu's eyes. Not only was he unperturbed, but he also burst into laughter, shouting, "Pleasant! Pleasant! But you're still doomed; I'll drain your blood! You’re worthy of me doing so!"

With just a sweep of the wolf fang club, both beast souls were sent flying, their roars fading away in midair, vanishing from sight.

However, this tiny delay allowed Yang Kai to execute his follow-up move. Three sword energies forged a path before him, and his entire body emanated an evil aura that suddenly transformed into a massive hand, sweeping down towards Le Yu!

Two months ago, Yang Kai could not control his energy at will to this extent.

But ever since learning the techniques of controlling Yuan Qi from Xiao Fusheng on Hidden Cloud Peak, his manipulation of this evil energy had reached an unparalleled level not comparable to before.

Although this control was still superficial, it was significantly better than before.

As Le Yu rapidly approached, he swung the club and shattered the three sword energies. His hair stood on end as purple evil energy surged around him. Before he could evade, the pitch-black hand slammed down directly onto him.

The ground seemed to sink under the might of the blow, and the azure stone slabs shattered into fragments, scattering everywhere.

In the swirling darkness, Le Yu completely vanished within the pitch-black abyss.

"Ah..." Bilo's mouth gaped wide open, her red lips parted in shock. She was at a loss for words; she had thought Yang Kai's previous performance was already impressive, but she had not anticipated that it was not even Yang Kai's true level.

The mystery and eeriness of this person far exceeded Bilo's imagination.

"Young master..." Several Divine Roaming Realm experts from the Le family exclaimed, but soon regained their composure, as they sensed through their Divine Sense that Le Yu's vitality had not weakened. Instead, it was rapidly boiling and growing in anger.

"This kid is impressive. He could make Le Yu suffer like this. Hahaha, I can't wait to see the look on old man Le Wuji's face when he hears about this!" one spectator from the Divine Roaming Realm laughed heartily, seemingly pleased to see Le Yu being bullied.

Le Wuju, the previous head of the Le family, was at the pinnacle of the Divine Roaming Realm and was an elder of Piaoxiang City.

"What a pity! The few elders and the master have gone to the Beast King’s territory; it seems they won’t see this!" another person laughed maliciously.

The Divine Roaming Realm experts of the Le family immediately turned somber, glaring hatefully at several people.

Yang Kai's expression was grim, his brows knitted slightly, as he carefully sensed the changes on Le Yu's side.

Suddenly, a flicker of purple light erupted from the endless darkness. This light was initially like a small flame, but quickly spread out like a prairie fire.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Streamers of purple evil energy broke through the darkness, shooting towards Yang Kai at lightning speed.

Each strand of this purple evil energy almost solidified, burning like flames, yet strangely had no warmth; instead, it was bone-chillingly cold.

Crack! Crack! Crack!

Yang Kai's own evil energy surged as black aura clashed furiously with the purple qi, resulting in a stalemate where neither could overwhelm the other.

Moments later, the purple energy retracted, breaking the confines of darkness, and Le Yu's sturdy figure reappeared in the eyes of the crowd.

"Hehehe..." Le Yu hoisted the massive wolf fang club on his shoulder, a sinister and eerie smile creeping across his face.

Yang Kai's expression darkened as he realized that his body was inexplicably aflame. Moreover, it was engulfed in purple evil fire!

The bone-chilling cold spread where the fire burned, swiftly enveloping his entire body.

The evil fire not only made a person feel cold to the bone but also rapidly consumed all energy within.

This was not a natural fire, but rather an effect produced when the purple evil energy reached a certain concentration.

The temperature of his body plummeted rapidly, taking the evil energy along with it. Yang Kai quickly became cloaked in a layer of frost, his hair and clothes turning pure white.

Le Yu's lips curled into a chilling smile.

"You are doomed!"

As he spoke, the purple tattoos on Le Yu’s body suddenly seemed to come alive, transforming into monstrous, terrifying venomous snakes that burst forth from his skin, baring their fangs and lunging at Yang Kai.

"This kid is finished." The spectators from the Divine Roaming Realm were once again animatedly commenting. This group, except for the experts of the Le family, consisted of those who delighted in chaos, unbothered whether the opponent was a noble guest or a young master from the Le family; witnessing an exciting battle was their priority.

If he were not frozen in ice, there was a chance he could still fight Le Yu, but now, encased in frost and slowed in movement, how could he evade Le Yu's attack?

Having reached this point, Le Yu charged towards Yang Kai, swinging the wolf fang club with the intent to finish him off!

"Stop!" Bilo cried out sharply, but how could Le Yu, consumed by an overwhelming desire to kill Yang Kai, pay her heed?

At that moment, a flurry of blood-red petals suddenly floated around Yang Kai.

An intoxicating floral fragrance wafted through the air.

The petals quickly gathered together, forming the shape of a begonia flower, vibrant and blooming, completely encasing Yang Kai within, leaving no gaps.

"Another Heaven-Grade treasure?" 

The Divine Roaming Realm experts' eyes nearly bulged out of their sockets, almost bursting from their sockets.

They suddenly realized the gravity of the situation!

If Yang Kai’s earlier display of a Heaven-Grade treasure had shown a hint of his formidable background, this blooming flower indicated that his ties were now truly significant.

At the very least, it was not something the Le family could contend with.

What kind of faction would allow a young man to carry two Heaven-Grade treasures on him? Especially such weapons imbued with overwhelming killing intent?

The Le family could not! Le Yu only had one Heaven-Grade treasure on him.

Who exactly was this young man? Was he related to the other Five Great Evil Kings, or was he a disciple of a hidden master?

The several Divine Roaming Realm experts of the Le family were utterly speechless, their mouths agape in astonishment.

"What are you still dawdling for? You fools! Hurry and stop Le Yu!" One observant Divine Roaming Realm expert, trying not to escalate the situation, urgently advised.

"Oh, oh!" The Le family experts finally awakened, not daring to hesitate as they rushed onto the battlefield.

Before the blooming Thousand-Petal Blood Sea Begonia, Le Yu raised the wolf fang club, unleashing his full power as he smashed down.

The flower bud shattered instantly, revealing Yang Kai inside.

With a muffled grunt, Yang Kai was sent flying. In mid-air, he spat out a mouthful of blood, but the purple evil fire that had originally surrounded him had mysteriously disappeared.

His expression cold, Yang Kai swiftly waved his hands, sending a thousand petals swirling through the air.

The sword energy from the Shura Sword flickered like a spirit snake in and out, endlessly consuming.

A massive sword light materialized, cleaving down towards Le Yu.

Le Yu's pupils constricted. With an enraged roar, his muscles tightened as he raised the wolf fang club to block the sword light, but the thousand petals surged toward him.

"Everyone, stop!" The Divine Roaming Realm experts from the Le family finally arrived, one blocking in front of Yang Kai while the others rushed toward Le Yu.

The combined efforts of several experts, through their coordinated movements, blocked the powers of the Thousand-Petal Blood Sea Begonia and the Shura Sword.

"Young master, don't fight anymore!"

"Get lost. I want to kill him; I can kill him!" Le Yu was enraged, his True Essence raging as he swung the wolf fang club, causing the Divine Roaming Realm experts to scramble in panic. "Anyone who obstructs me, I will kill them!"

The few Divine Roaming Realm experts exchanged glances, mutually understanding the predicament they were in, and suddenly nodded in agreement. They quickly took action.

The sounds of clashing filled the air as they swiftly struck and knocked Le Yu unconscious.

They had no choice; if they knocked Le Yu out, he would inevitably face backlash from the Purple Qi Evil Body, as he still could not fully control the evil energy within him.

Because of this concern, they hadn’t intervened even when they realized Wang Kai's significance earlier.

But after Yang Kai revealed a second Heaven-Grade treasure, they had no choice but to intervene.

This development had suddenly escalated!

Le Yu sustaining injuries was no big deal, but provoking the power behind Yang Kai was a significant risk.

They feared that the force or master behind Yang Kai was something the Le family could not afford to offend.

Moreover, he was also a distinguished guest of Shan Qingluo! It was even more unwise to provoke him.

"What does this mean?" Yang Kai coldly stared at the Le family Divine Roaming Realm expert blocking his way, methodically retracting his Thousand-Petal Blood Sea Begonia, and casually asked.

"Young master..." The Le family Divine Roaming Realm expert furrowed his brow, cupping his hands in salute, and forced a smile, saying, "Young master, please do not be angry. My young master has offended you previously. I hope you can show mercy. You also saw that my young master, using the Purple Qi Evil Body, has somewhat lost his rationality and does not truly wish to fight you to the death. Let this battle... stop here." 

Yang Kai raised an eyebrow and mocked, "The Le family is quite imposing, able to start a battle at will and cease it as they please?"

"This..." The Le family’s Divine Roaming Realm expert was suddenly at a loss for words, his expression awkward.

However, he could not refute; it had been stated beforehand that they were merely here to purchase pills, yet their young master had insisted on causing trouble.

Just as he was pondering how to respond, Yang Kai casually remarked, "Since you have knocked him out, even if I wish to fight, I won’t be able to do so."

"Young master, please forgive us!" The Le family experts smiled, relieved, grateful that Yang Kai seemed reasonable.

Yang Kai snorted coldly, turning to leave, and his icy voice echoed, "This matter is not over!"

The expressions of the Le family members immediately soured!
