## Chapter 378 — Lü Si

Lü Liang truly found himself at a loss.

Yang Kai simply could not understand. Although he was the head of the Lü Family, Yang Kai's own status was not low either. Despite the anger boiling within, Lü Liang could not express it openly and could only speak in a gentle tone, hoping this young master Yang could grasp the meaning behind his words, for both their conveniences.

Yet this Young Master Yang was clearly not a perceptive person; he seemed singularly focused, completely oblivious, and asked in surprise, “Why do we need to go elsewhere?”

Veins on Lü Liang’s forehead twitched slightly.

Suppressing the frustration and anger within, he wore a serious expression and said, “To be honest, Young Master Yang, this place is where a master of my family is in seclusion. Normally, no one would disturb him, and with us speaking like this, I fear we might disturb the old man. If that happens… heh.”

“A master?” Yang Kai stood up immediately, his voice rising like thunder.

The expressions of those from the Lü Family rapidly soured.

This guy… is he doing this on purpose?

Yang Kai appeared oblivious, eagerly looking around with great interest, and after a full circuit, he smiled broadly and gazed at Lü Liang, asking, “How skilled?”

“Young Master Yang!” Lü Liang’s face darkened, letting out a light snort, he could no longer endure, “Please exercise restraint!”

It was truly remarkable for Lü Liang to be pushed to say such words.

If this were not the seclusion of Lü Si, Lü Liang would have never dared to risk offending Yang Kai and display such displeasure.

Yang Kai was momentarily taken aback and chuckled.

His laughter was relaxed; it did not convey any ulterior motives, merely a hint of surprise.

He genuinely had not expected this place to be a significant location for the Lü Family!

He knew there must be a master residing here; otherwise, it would not be such a grand affair to have the Golden Feather Eagle drop off the porcupine while he snuck in.

Despite knowing there was a master here, Yang Kai only realized how serious it was when Lü Liang and the others appeared hurriedly. He feared he had touched a nerve of the Lü Family that should not be touched.

However, with the situation at hand, he could only play the fool to avoid awkwardness on both sides.

Yang Kai was not oblivious to the nuances. The moment Lü Liang and the others appeared, he sensed something was amiss, and now with Lü Liang's displeasure clear, he could ascertain who was in seclusion at this location.

The only master of the Lü Family at the beyond the Divine Roaming Realm!

Otherwise, Lü Liang would not be so tense and cautious.

Interesting; the very thing he was interested in was situated within such a master’s dwelling. This was indeed a bit troublesome.

Furrowing his brow, Yang Kai pondered whether to let it go when suddenly, the large door of a nearby room creaked open.

A soft sound echoed.

Lü Liang and the others trembled as their expressions turned solemn. They quickly turned to face the door and bowed in unison.

“That little friend, come in and speak.” An aged voice emanated from within, flat and devoid of emotion, yet it struck awe into the hearts of everyone outside.

Yang Kai's gaze flickered, and he laughed lightly. He did not hesitate and stepped forward.

Lü Liang watched with envy and followed slowly behind.

Arriving at the entrance, Yang Kai halted, turning back to Lü Liang with a gesture, “Please, Lü Family Head.”

Lü Liang forced a bitter smile and waved his hands repeatedly, “No, no! Elder Si only summons you; you may go in.”

Saying this, he led the others to disperse outside, standing straight with a solemn expression.

Yang Kai glanced at him, understanding he was not merely being polite, nodded slightly, and stepped into the room.

The room was simple, lacking even a bed, with only tables and chairs. Upon the table sat a purple clay teapot, and nothing else was present.

However, the moment Yang Kai entered, his eyes emitted a burning gaze, greedily fixed on something beneath the elder sitting there.

His gaze was unrestrained, showing no signs of concealment whatsoever!

The elder in the room was evidently Lü Si, the strongest of the Lü Family. Lü Si appeared somewhat frail, with white hair and beard, his temperament somewhat similar to Ling Taixu, though lacking in the latter's indifference and detachment from worldly matters.

Nevertheless, Lü Si still exuded the unique demeanor of a master.

Yang Kai had now encountered his second person at the beyond the Divine Roaming Realm.

Upon reaching the beyond the Divine Roaming Realm, it seemed to impart an aura of transcendence over all. This feeling was ineffable and deeply mysterious.

Any individual at the beyond the Divine Roaming Realm stood high upon the pinnacle of mastery.

At this moment, Lü Si was seated cross-legged on a massive piece of jade, which was entirely golden, radiant streams of light flowing over the surface, akin to fish frolicking in water.

This jade appeared like a naturally occurring bed, capable of accommodating a person lying upon it.

Lü Si sat there, his aura long and lingering.

The energy within the jade was extraordinarily subtle; even standing a zhang away, Yang Kai could perceive not a single ripple. Yet, the Yang Source Seal on his chest throbbed incessantly.

The Yang Source Seal only reacted to the presence of Yang attribute treasures. With this object, Yang Kai could precisely seek out Yang attribute miraculous treasures.

From the moment Yang Kai entered the Lü Family, he had sensed the existence of this great piece of jade.

Thus, he had told Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian that there was something of great interest in the Lü Family. Ultimately, he only knew it to be a Yang attribute treasure without specifics.

Now, upon seeing it, it did not disappoint.

Such a large piece of naturally occurring jade, if absorbed completely into his Dantian, could potentially elevate his strength by an entire stage.

Since exhausting the Yang Liquid in the Bloodthirsty Evil Cave, his reserves had diminished significantly. If the Yang Liquid were to run out, Yang Kai was uncertain whether the malevolent energy within his Proud Bone Golden Body would erupt uncontrollably, influencing him, and depleted Yang Liquid would render all techniques reliant on it ineffective.

Hence, during this period, what Yang Kai most desired was to replenish his Yang Liquid.

However, Yang attribute miraculous treasures were hard to come by, and even returning to the Yang Family would not yield any assistance. Every son of a great family vying for the heirship must rely solely on their own accumulated talents and resources.

Now that he encountered such a tremendous opportunity, how could he let it slip by easily?

He never expected that the treasure he coveted was, in fact, a bed for a master at the beyond the Divine Roaming Realm!

Yang Kai's expression turned strange, contemplating what kind of conditions he could present to persuade the elder to part with it willingly.

Furthermore, this would require him to do it with empty hands, increasing the challenge.

For a moment, Yang Kai also felt a sense of indecision, though on the surface, he remained composed, still fixated on the jade beneath the elder.

Lü Si had been watching Yang Kai since he entered. Initially with indifference, but after a moment, he could not help but chuckle in surprise, “Little friend, your intentions are quite evident, it seems you came prepared!”

Yang Kai finally retrieved his greedy gaze, chuckling, “I apologize for my rudeness!”

All his schemes and thoughts were likely already seen through by a master at the beyond the Divine Roaming Realm. At this stage, Yang Kai would not attempt to argue.

As he spoke, he sat cross-legged before Lü Si.

Outside, the executives of the Lü Family listened intently, holding their breaths, eager to hear what the two inside were discussing.

“The Young Master of the Yang Family is truly extraordinary.” Lü Si nodded slightly, a hint of admiration appearing on his face, “After all, you come from a great family, such aura and composure are not something the Lü Family could cultivate.”

Yang Kai grinned, “You flatter me, Elder Si. The Lü Family is not lacking, either.”

Lü Si chuckled.

After all, he was a master at the beyond the Divine Roaming Realm. Unless it was the sons of the Eight Great Families of Zhongdu, anyone else who came to see him would likely be somewhat reserved and cautious. Yet this young man before him seemed entirely unconcerned, stepping right in and focusing solely on what lay beneath him, completely disregarding his presence. If he had not seen the world, if he were not of noble descent, how could he remain so calm?

“Are you here for that?” Lü Si inquired directly, pointing beneath him.

“Indeed!” Yang Kai admitted freely, “It’s not premeditated, but rather an impromptu decision, heh heh!”

“Why would you need it?”

“I do need it, and I need it urgently!” Yang Kai’s expression turned serious.

“Old man understands.” Lü Si nodded slightly and suddenly smiled, “While I understand, I still cannot give it to you.”

“I understand that.” Yang Kai showed no signs of disappointment, clearly having anticipated this, sitting up straight, “Hence, I wish to discuss conditions with you.”

Lü Si watched him with interest, “Even if you are the Young Master of the Yang Family, I do not wish to, nor can I, discuss any conditions with you, so you are destined to be disappointed.”

Yang Kai shook his head, “Elder, your words are somewhat rash. In this world, as long as it is a thing, there exists a price that would compel you to part with it. It’s merely a matter of whether I can afford it.”

Lü Si still shook his head, resolute.

Those outside the Lü Family listened closely, and after hearing for a while, they all began to wear strange expressions.

Although they absorbed every word exchanged between the elder and the youth, they remained utterly confused.

Why did it seem that this Young Master of the Yang Family had his sights set on something from their family?

Was there planning involved?

Or was it a spur-of-the-moment idea?

A heartbreaking price?

Was he buying it or attempting to take it?

Members of the Lü Family exchanged glances, thoroughly perplexed.

Inside, Lü Si chuckled, “Young Master Yang, you needn’t trouble yourself. I called you in not to discuss this.”

“Elder, you certainly don’t wish to discuss this; I understand that.” Yang Kai nodded slightly and smiled brightly, “But I really have my eyes on this jade bed of yours!”

Lü Si showed no immediate response, but out of the room, when Lü Liang heard this, his expression changed dramatically, his voice filled with anger, interjecting, “Young Master Yang, the Yang Crystal Jade Bed beneath Elder Si is the most important treasure of my Lü Family; no one is allowed to lay their hands on it!”

Today, Lü Liang had already endured Yang Kai’s provocations multiple times without exploding. But upon hearing that the thing Yang Kai desired was the Yang Crystal Jade Bed, Lü Liang could no longer restrain himself and snapped back, his tone direct and forthright, clearly suggesting that Yang Kai would face serious consequences if he persisted.
