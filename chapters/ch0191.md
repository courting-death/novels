## Chapter 191 — Wings of Yang Flame

Generally speaking, when an Earth Demon dares to guarantee something with its soul, there is a ninety-nine percent certainty.

Hearing this, Yang Kai couldn't help but grow serious.

If that truly was the so-called Heavenly Dao energy, he would undoubtedly gain something from it. Reflecting on everything that had just occurred, Yang Kai focused his attention on the area around his shoulder blades.

At the moment when that strange energy was refined away, he felt a surge of heat at his shoulder blades, but aside from that, there were no other abnormalities.

As he concentrated on this area, Yang Kai distinctly felt that all of his Primordial Qi was rushing towards his shoulder blades, and an inexplicable feeling of being bound arose within him.

This feeling prompted him to involuntarily increase the output of his Primordial Qi.

Suddenly, the bindings were broken.

With a soft sound, the entire cave was suddenly illuminated with brilliant light, startling Yang Kai.

"My heavens..." The Earth Demon groaned, and if it had a physical form, it would surely be in a state of shock. This old demon had lived for countless years; although it had been sealed away, it had recently emerged, and its vast knowledge meant that few things in the world could catch it off guard.

But now, it was caught off guard...

"This..." Yang Kai was also stunned, never expecting such a bizarre event to occur.

From his back, two wings formed purely from True Yang Yuan Qi sprouted forth. The wings were not large, only about half a zhang in length, and the True Yang Yuan Qi that composed them appeared somewhat unstable, swaying and trembling with the fluctuations of Yang Kai's emotions.

Casting a sidelong glance, Yang Kai's eyes trembled slightly.

These wings, sprouting from his shoulder blades, exuded an air of grandeur and elegance, especially the color of the True Yang Yuan Qi, which resembled blazing flames, giving off a wild and unrestrained feeling.

Neither Yang Kai nor the Earth Demon spoke, as if they had lost the ability to communicate, their minds entirely focused on the pair of wings.

After a long while, Yang Kai suddenly regained his senses and furrowed his brow, asking, "Earth Demon, what is this?"

The sound of the Earth Demon swallowing saliva emerged: "The power of flight!"

"A secret treasure?"

"No. This is far more precious than a secret treasure. This is the ability bestowed upon you by the Heavenly Dao energy, and the intricacies of it are something this old servant does not fully understand. Only you can comprehend it in the future."

Yang Kai nodded slightly. With a thought, the Wings of Yang Flame on his back flapped, stirring up a light breeze in the cave, and he actually lifted off the ground.

However, he hadn't flown very high before crashing into the cave wall. The Wings of Yang Flame suddenly vanished, and Yang Kai fell headfirst to the ground, disoriented.

After carefully experimenting for a long time, Yang Kai confirmed that he had indeed gained the power of flight from the Heaven-Devouring Insect, and that the Wings of Yang Flame were indeed formed from the True Yang Yuan Qi within him.

With this confirmation, Yang Kai couldn't help but feel a sense of relief!

With the people from the Yunxia Sect in trouble on the Hidden Island, Yang Kai had been somewhat worried these past few days, unsure of how he would return.

Originally, he had planned to cultivate to the True Essence Realm, gain the ability to fly, and then make plans, or perhaps capture a flying demon beast on this Hidden Island to carry him back. However, neither method seemed reliable.

After all, the Hidden Island was thousands of miles away from Haicheng, and even a Divine Roaming Realm expert might not be able to fly that far. Not to mention the True Essence Realm and the demon beasts he could catch?

Now, however, he could actually condense a pair of Wings of Yang Flame from his True Yang Yuan Qi, resolving the problem that had been troubling him.

According to the Earth Demon, these Wings of Yang Flame originated from the residual Heavenly Dao energy within the Heaven-Devouring Insect; they were neither a secret treasure nor a martial technique, but rather a special ability that had evolved.

However, to use this ability, one still needed to consume Primordial Qi, and quite a bit at that.

The cave was not suitable for testing the Wings of Yang Flame, so Yang Kai suppressed his excitement and suddenly thought of another question: "Earth Demon, what about those insects outside..."

"Young Master, you are overthinking it. The Heaven-Devouring Insect is exceedingly rare; although it has spawned many offspring, the insects outside can no longer be considered Heaven-Devouring Insects; they are merely a type of demon beast."

Yang Kai sighed. Upon reflection, it made sense. If every one of those insects contained Heavenly Dao energy, it would be a disaster.

His expression brightened again as he said, "However, after refining the Heaven-Devouring Insect, I feel like I can control those strange insects!"

"Is that so?" The Earth Demon was astonished.

"We'll find out if I try." Yang Kai's thoughts shifted, and soon a large swarm of strange insects surged towards him from outside. There were large and small ones, but they all stopped at the entrance of the cave, as if it were a forbidden area for them.

"Haha! It really is so!" Yang Kai laughed heartily.

Although those small insects were not lethal, their numbers were overwhelming. What pleased Yang Kai even more were the larger insects, each of which was a third or fourth-tier demon beast, with two of them even reaching the fifth tier.

The fifth tier was equivalent to a True Essence Realm expert.

With their assistance in searching for treasures on the Hidden Island, things would undoubtedly be much easier.

This trip into the tiger's den had truly been worthwhile.

In a good mood, Yang Kai stepped out of the cave, and the swarm of insects quickly retreated, voluntarily making way. The Earth Demon, seeing this scene, couldn't help but click its tongue in wonder.

With this matter settled, Yang Kai initially planned to leave the insect den directly, taking this group of strange insects to rampage across the Hidden Island. But suddenly, he thought of someone.

Yu Aoqing! The fate of this proud daughter of the Yunxia Sect was currently unknown to him.

If she had already died, then naturally, dust would return to dust, and he could let go of any previous grievances. If she was still alive, Yang Kai wanted to bring her along.

It wasn't out of a desire to take care of her, but because there were certainly still experts from the Yunxia Sect on the Hidden Island. If he accidentally encountered those experts after going out, having Yu Aoqing with him would be a bargaining chip.

With this in mind, Yang Kai followed the path in his memory towards the place where Yu Aoqing was imprisoned.

After walking for a long time, he finally arrived at the previous cave. However, as soon as Yang Kai peeked inside, his expression immediately changed.

In this cave, there was not just Yu Aoqing.

In addition to her, there were three others!

Two of them were disciples from the younger generation of Yunxia, while the other was an elder from Yunxia, whose name Yang Kai had heard while on the big ship.

Meng Xingyuan, although his strength could not compare to Yu Xiuping, was still a True Essence Seventh Layer expert.

What were they doing here? Yang Kai was momentarily stunned.

It could be considered Yu Aoqing's luck that Meng Xingyuan and the others were here. After the big ship was destroyed that day, the people from Yunxia scattered. Meng Xingyuan gathered several disciples and, like Yu Aoqing, was exploring the Hidden Island while searching for their sect members.

After many days of encountering numerous dangers, the disciples had suffered heavy casualties, and now only two remained.

Today, upon arriving here, they noticed that the mist surrounding the area was somewhat strange. Meng Xingyuan led the two disciples to fly in and investigate. Upon investigation, they discovered Qi Yuan's corpse and subsequently followed the trail to find this insect den.

At the entrance of the insect den, there was a piece of torn fabric from Yu Aoqing's dress. Meng Xingyuan immediately sensed that something was amiss and led the two disciples to sneak in. He initially thought it would be difficult, but unexpectedly, they encountered no attacks along the way and easily found Yu Aoqing.

Little did they know that all those insects had been summoned away by Yang Kai, which was why it had gone so smoothly.

When Yang Kai returned, Meng Xingyuan and the Yunxia disciple had just arrived not long ago. Yu Aoqing, in a daze and trembling with fear, recounted her experiences over the past few days, as well as the fates of Zhang Yu and Luo Qianqian.

Just as they were speaking, Yang Kai appeared, and both sides were momentarily stunned.

Meng Xingyuan did not remember such a disciple in Yunxia, while Yu Aoqing clearly did not expect Yang Kai to return alive.

But soon, a hint of resentment and anger surged in Yu Aoqing's eyes as she gritted her teeth and said, "Uncle Meng, this person is not a disciple of our Yunxia Sect, but a thief who mixed in on the ship. Qi Yuan was killed by him, so please, Uncle Meng, take action to avenge Junior Brother Qi Yuan!"

She did not mention Yang Kai's previous humiliation of her, fearing that it would be bad for her reputation if it spread.

Previously, she had not dared to act against Yang Kai because, first, there were only the two of them in this place, and they shared a sense of mutual suffering. Second, she was exhausted in body and mind and was not Yang Kai's opponent.

But now it was different; Meng Xingyuan and the others had found this place, and she could leave safely. As for Yang Kai, the man who had once stripped her of her clothes and humiliated her, Yu Aoqing was not willing to let him go.

She wished she could tear Yang Kai to pieces to relieve the hatred in her heart!

As long as he was dead, that day's events would remain unknown, and she would still be the proud daughter of Yunxia in the future!

After saying this, Yu Aoqing raised her head slightly, looking arrogantly at Yang Kai, her eyes filled with the delight of revenge.

Meng Xingyuan's expression turned cold as he shouted, "You brat, you have some guts! You dare to kill my Yunxia disciple! Kill him for me!"

This was directed at the two Yunxia disciples.

As soon as he finished speaking, the two of them did not hesitate to attack Yang Kai!

Yang Kai gazed deeply at Yu Aoqing, a trace of coldness flashing in his eyes. With a flicker of his figure, he shot out over ten zhang away. When the two Yunxia disciples caught up, Yang Kai flickered away again, disappearing without a trace after several consecutive movements.

"What incredible speed!" Meng Xingyuan couldn't help but exclaim, marveling at the extraordinary footwork, wondering what level of martial technique it was.

"Qing'er, you can still walk, right?" Meng Xingyuan asked.

"Mm." Yu Aoqing nodded.

"Follow your uncle out. I want to see how that brat escapes from that circle of mist!" Meng Xingyuan snorted coldly, not in a hurry. As long as that circle of mist remained, martial artists below the True Essence Realm would not be able to leave, unless they had a flying secret treasure.

"Uncle, you must kill him. He even tried to humiliate Junior Sister Luo Qianqian before. If I hadn't stopped him, he would have succeeded!" Yu Aoqing's beautiful eyes were frosty, without a shred of guilt as she blamed Yang Kai.

Meng Xingyuan was indeed furious: "Daring to lay hands on my Yunxia disciple, truly audacious! Rest assured, I will catch him and make sure he suffers!"

Yu Aoqing revealed a chilling smile.
