## Chapter 117 — Conquest and Breakthrough

Throughout this night of fierce battle, Yang Kai’s body had bled profusely, the extent of his injuries unknown even to himself. Only now did Xia Ningshang realize that her junior brother’s calm composure from beginning to end was sustained solely by an indomitable will.

Such grievous wounds would have sent any ordinary person to the brink of death countless times over, yet he had gritted his teeth and endured, all to fight alongside her, to slay the last enemy and secure the Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew.

Having accomplished all this, his spirit finally relaxed, and naturally, his body could no longer hold out.

Suppressing the ache in her heart, Xia Ningshang fumbled anxiously to retrieve the remaining pills from Yang Kai’s body, then searched through Wen Feichen’s belongings, forcing herself to calm down before feeding some healing pills into Yang Kai’s mouth.

But Yang Kai was unconscious; he could not swallow the pills. With no other choice, Xia Ningshang personally chewed the pills into a paste and fed them to him.

Amidst this chaos, the Nine Yin Eight Lock Formation that had sealed the entire valley suddenly trembled and then shattered.

Dawn had come! The sun rose in the east, and the Nine Yin Eight Lock Formation collapsed without a fight.

Xia Ningshang did not notice the change in the valley and continued her desperate efforts to save Yang Kai.

A powerful yet gentle Divine Sense swept over her, causing her body to shudder. She suddenly looked up toward the sky, and in the next moment, a figure abruptly appeared before her.

“Master!” Seeing him was like spotting a savior; Xia Ningshang’s pent-up emotions finally found release, and tears streamed down her face.

Meng Wuya wore a stern expression and was about to scold Xia Ningshang when he sensed something amiss and was startled. “What happened?”

Meng Wuya had lingered outside the Nine Yin Eight Lock Formation all night, unwilling to break it prematurely. He had thought capturing the Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew would be straightforward—after all, he had prepared for Xia Ningshang for many years, everything ready except for the final moment. As long as Yang Kai cooperated, the Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew would be theirs without fail.

Of course, his precious disciple would have to make some sacrifices.

Having waited outside all night, Meng Wuya was also frustrated. Which master would be drugged by their own disciple? Perhaps none in the world. He was not angry about losing face but furious that Xia Ningshang had recklessly ventured deep into Black Wind Mountain. What if danger had befallen her?

Originally, Meng Wuya had intended to mildly reprimand Xia Ningshang once the formation was broken—though not too harshly, for he cherished this disciple like a treasure.

But the scene before him silenced his words. Staring gravely at the unconscious Yang Kai on the ground, he asked in a deep voice, “What happened?”

“Master, please save him!” Xia Ningshang sobbed bitterly, pleading.

Without hesitation, Meng Wuya bent down and placed two fingers on Yang Kai’s wrist. His Divine Sense swept through Yang Kai’s body, his brow furrowing in shock. “Such severe injuries?”

To Meng Wuya, Yang Kai’s wounds were not merely severe—they were near death. It was unclear how he had sustained them. The internal injuries to his chest and the external wounds were bad enough, but the most critical issue was the chaotic Primordial Qi coursing through his meridians and the extensive damage to his flesh and blood.

Such injuries could not be healed without a peerless elixir, and even then, only a master physician could treat them.

Meng Wuya had neither.

“Master, will he die?” Xia Ningshang asked, grief-stricken and deeply worried.

Seeing her expression, Meng Wuya knew the situation was dire. He sighed inwardly, lamenting fate’s cruelty. Despite all his precautions, he had failed.

Not wishing to see Xia Ningshang despair, Meng Wuya comforted her, “Do not worry. With me here, he will not die.” As he spoke, he produced a small bottle from his bosom and poured out a single pill about the size of a longan fruit, glowing golden—clearly no ordinary medicine.

Seeing the pill, Xia Ningshang’s anxious expression eased somewhat, for she understood its potent power.

With a trace of reluctance, Meng Wuya hesitated before, under Xia Ningshang’s insistent gaze, prying open Yang Kai’s mouth to administer the pill.

“I’ll do it!” Xia Ningshang suddenly snatched the pill, bit it into pieces, then bent down and used her tongue to wrap the medicine, feeding it into Yang Kai’s bloodied mouth.

“Hey, I’m still here!” Meng Wuya silently protested, quickly averting his gaze.

Witnessing his disciple’s unabashed closeness to a man, Meng Wuya felt a pang of discomfort, as if the daughter he had painstakingly raised was about to leave him.

Once the pill was swallowed, Yang Kai’s expression seemed to improve slightly, though not as much as expected.

Meng Wuya took the opportunity to survey the surroundings. His previously clouded eyes suddenly gleamed with cold light as he spotted Wen Feichen’s corpse and Long Hui’s shattered limbs.

His doubts vanished.

Yang Kai’s grievous wounds and Xia Ningshang’s battered state were the aftermath of a fierce battle. Now, the reason was clear.

A surge of fury churned within Meng Wuya’s chest, his face darkening with grim resolve.

He did not ask questions immediately—now was not the time. There would be ample opportunity to uncover the events of the previous night.

Meng Wuya’s regret was profound. Had he broken the Nine Yin Eight Lock Formation the moment he arrived, Yang Kai and his disciple would not have suffered so.

Frustration and regret fermented into raging anger.

Taking a deep breath to suppress his wrath, Meng Wuya spoke softly, “Disciple, have you secured the Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew?”

“Yes,” Xia Ningshang nodded blankly, still staring at the unconscious Yang Kai.

“Then begin refining it at once. Yang Kai, do not worry. With me here, you shall not die,” Meng Wuya reassured.

After a moment’s hesitation, Xia Ningshang nodded and cautioned, “Master, please take care of him. I owe my life to him. If not for his desperate protection, I would already be…”

Her voice broke as tears welled again.

“Rest assured,” Meng Wuya forced a faint smile and nodded.

Xia Ningshang composed herself, wiped her eyes, and took out the package she carried. While keeping a close watch on Yang Kai’s condition, she began refining the Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew.

Half an hour later, the refinement was complete. However, Xia Ningshang suppressed the medicinal effects within her dantian without absorbing them. Absorbing the essence would consume time, and once finished, she would advance to the True Essence Realm, which would require further effort.

Yang Kai remained unconscious; she had no mood for such matters.

“Let us leave this place. He needs proper rest and recuperation in his current state,” Meng Wuya said as he bent down and lifted Yang Kai. Together with Xia Ningshang, they swiftly departed Black Wind Mountain.

They did not head straight to Lingxiao Pavilion, for it was quite distant. Instead, they arrived at the small town where Yang Kai and Xia Ningshang had stayed previously.

They found an inn and settled in temporarily. Xia Ningshang tirelessly tended to Yang Kai’s bedside every day with utmost care.

Meng Wuya visited daily as well, pouring True Essence into Yang Kai to aid his recovery.

Since losing consciousness, Yang Kai found his awareness transported to a void-like realm. In this world, there was nothing but the Proud Bone Golden Body he had previously acquired from the Wordless Black Book.

The golden body sat cross-legged, radiant with golden light. Yang Kai also sat cross-legged before it, motionless.

No sound, no light—Yang Kai kept his gaze fixed on the golden body. Though it had no eyes, he felt as if it was watching him in return.

Time passed, though how long he could not say. Yang Kai and the golden body remained in this silent communion.

He was contemplating the mysteries of the golden body. When he last comprehended the Unyielding Will, he sensed hidden secrets within it yet to be unraveled, though he lacked the strength then.

After enduring a night of life-and-death battle, Yang Kai suddenly felt the distance between himself and the golden body had greatly diminished.

If before there had been a barrier between them, now it had vanished.

His unyielding spirit and will had conquered the golden body’s pride. It was pleased to have found a worthy master.

Suddenly, Yang Kai smiled.

The golden body shimmered and transformed into countless specks of golden light, merging into his body as it had when first encountered.

But Yang Kai knew that only now did he truly possess the Proud Bone Golden Body. Though it had merged before, it had never fully submitted. It had observed and tested him, and only after his performance earned its trust did it willingly become part of him.

The void world shattered abruptly, and Yang Kai’s consciousness returned to his body.

He did not open his eyes immediately but examined his current condition.

His wounds were mostly stable, though his chest still ached slightly. The sword wounds on his abdomen and shoulder were healing well.

Within his dantian, the forty-plus drops of Yang Liquid had dwindled to only seven or eight. The battle had been tremendously taxing.

Just the Yang Liquid used against Senior Brother Cai and Wen Feichen alone had consumed twenty drops. He had also resisted the invading cold and fought for so long.

Though much Yang Liquid was lost, he had not gained nothing. This battle had propelled his realm from the Fourth Stage of the Open Origin Realm to the Seventh Stage!

Advancing three minor stages at once, even Yang Kai was astonished.

Reflecting carefully, during the fierce fight with Wen Feichen, when he used the Unyielding Will, he had briefly attained the strength of the Qi Movement Realm. It must have been then that he broke through.

This breakthrough had gone unnoticed by Yang Kai himself. Had he not examined his condition now, he might have remained unaware.
