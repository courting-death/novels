## Chapter 478 — She Is a Woman

Regarding the mysterious expert, Earth Demon was not clear on the details and immediately inquired with curiosity.

Yang Kai briefly recounted the two encounters he had had with that person.

After listening, Earth Demon was also somewhat astonished, staring dumbfoundedly at Meng Wuya. “Even you couldn’t discern that fellow’s true nature?”

Shopkeeper Meng slowly shook his head. “That person carries a unique aura that blocks any external probing. I estimate that even someone beyond the Divine Roaming Realm would find it quite difficult to peer through. If this person wishes to conceal themselves, no one can find them.”

“Impressive!” Earth Demon praised, then chuckled slyly, “However, judging from his fights with Ying Jiu and the Young Master, his strength doesn’t seem too outstanding.”

Near the pill workshop, that man was lightly wounded by a Shadow Dance Kill strike from Ying Jiu. At Po Jing Lake, Yang Kai’s sword attack couldn’t be completely evaded either. If his strength were truly profound enough to rival Meng Wuya and Earth Demon, none of that would have occurred.

Yang Kai nodded lightly. “But still, not weak—definitely an expert.”

“What does the Young Master intend to do?” Earth Demon’s expression brightened, his grin turning ferocious.

“I will say this upfront: don’t expect me to get involved.” Meng Wuya glanced at Yang Kai. “I’m here solely to protect that girl, Ning Shang. I won’t meddle in the chaos of War City.”

He muttered after, “I am old and have no face to interfere in the matters of the young.”

“No need for you to intervene.” Yang Kai chuckled softly. “I just want to ask if either of you has any good way to draw that person out from the shadows.”

Meng Wuya shook his head slightly. Earth Demon was suddenly at a loss. Even Meng Wuya could not do anything against that person; Earth Demon wouldn’t dare to make any promises either. Only if that person appeared again at Yang Kai’s residence would there be a slim chance, but after the last time, the snake was already alarmed. If their mind was normal, no further actions would be taken in the short term.

“Young Master, without any information about that person... even a skillful woman cannot cook without rice.” Earth Demon gave a wry laugh.

“We do have one piece of information.” Yang Kai suddenly said after a moment’s consideration.

“What?” Meng Wuya and Earth Demon looked over simultaneously.

“She is a woman.” Yang Kai’s gaze deepened.

“How do you know?” Shopkeeper Meng frowned.

Yang Kai smiled faintly, pulling out a strand of cyan hair from his pocket. Placing it before them, he explained, “This was cut from her at Po Jing Lake.”

He paused briefly, then continued, “However, I don’t understand why her hair is this color. Both of you are accomplished and learned; have you ever seen hair of this hue?”

Meng Wuya and Earth Demon looked at the strand of cyan hair, their expressions involuntarily filled with astonishment.

This strand was entirely different from ordinary women’s hair. Most people, male or female, have black hair, yet this strand was pale blue.

Like pure lake water, smooth and soft, but the color was strikingly unique.

After a moment of stunned silence, Meng Wuya and Earth Demon exchanged a glance, a strange expression briefly flashing across their faces.

Yang Kai observed their reactions and silently guessed that something had occurred to them.

After a moment’s contemplation, Meng Wuya spoke, “I do not know who this woman is, nor have I ever heard of such hair color. But I suspect it relates to her cultivation method and physique. Yang Kai, do not underestimate her; this woman may have an extraordinary background.”

There was implication in Meng Wuya’s words. Though unspoken, Yang Kai’s expression grew solemn as he nodded.

He had never taken her lightly to begin with.

Earth Demon suddenly gave a sly chuckle. “Young Master, if this strand indeed comes from her, then I might have a way to find her!”

“Oh?” Yang Kai’s face brightened. “Are you sure?”

“Haha... soul-tracing and life-seizing are specialties of mine! With this strand, she won’t be able to hide before me!” Earth Demon was full of confidence.

“Dark arts and demon cultivation!” Meng Wuya scoffed.

Earth Demon was unfazed, his smile broadening with merriment.

Yang Kai didn’t care what methods he used. As long as they could find that mysterious woman, he eagerly asked, “How long will it take?”

“About ten days to prepare. But it depends on opportunity. If she doesn’t come near me, I won’t be able to trace her.”

“Then prepare as soon as possible!” Yang Kai said gravely.

No matter her motives for approaching the pill workshop, failing once meant she would come again. From her appearance at Po Jing Lake, this person was absolutely bold and arrogant, looking down on all heroes. Such a person would be confident and conceited, unwilling to retreat over a small setback. Once she found a way to fully conceal her aura, she would surely return.

When she comes again, it will be her own downfall.

Handing over the pale blue hair to Earth Demon, Yang Kai hurried away.

Near the refinement workshop, he found Qiu Yimeng busy and spoke to her in secret. No one knew what was said, but Qiu Yimeng’s expression grew excited and resolute. She protested fiercely and even grabbed Yang Kai’s arm, refusing to let go.

Miss Qiu rarely behaved disrespectfully; her noble birth and good upbringing gave her refined manners. To pull Yang Kai in public, as if he had seduced and abandoned her, drew the attention of passing martial artists, who quietly speculated.

In the end, Yang Kai broke free from Qiu Yimeng’s hold and strode away, leaving the young lady alone—worried and fuming as she stamped her feet.

“Miss Qiu, what’s wrong with my junior brother?” Lan Chudie had just refined a treasure and came out for some air, seeing the scene and feeling curious.

“Nothing.” Qiu Yimeng quickly calmed herself and shook her head.

Lan Chudie smiled faintly and did not pry; she knew her current status barred her from such high secrets.

On the other side, the Hu Family sisters gazed out the window and quietly observed.

“See that? That despicable man is nothing but a lecher. So shameless to flirt with that Miss Qiu in broad daylight. Little sister, be careful not to fall for him!” Hu Jiao’er warned her younger sibling bitterly.

Hu Mei’er propped her cheek with her hand, daydreaming as if unaware.

Seeing her sister’s lovestruck look, Hu Jiao’er shook her head and sighed, pinching her sister’s small nose and swaying it gently. “Focus on cultivation!”

“Oh.” Hu Mei’er reluctantly withdrew her gaze.

Though the Blood Battle Gang and Fengyu Tower had only recently allied themselves with Yang Kai’s residence, Qiu Yimeng had not neglected their pill supply. Thanks to the mysterious pills provided, the Hu sisters’ cultivation progressed much faster. In just a few days, their Consonant Spirit Technique was nearing a breakthrough.

Moreover, after taking these pills, the Hu sisters clearly sensed subtle changes inside their bodies. They absorbed Heavenly Primordial Qi more easily, their meridians more sturdy and stable, and their cultivation method’s operation swifter than before.

Yang Kai’s talent and strength pressured them. They knew they must work hard or be left far behind in cultivation.

...

At night, on the eastern side of War City, at the Yang Wei residence.

Yang Wei was refining a recently acquired Mystery-Grade treasure when a knock sounded at the door. Frowning, he asked loudly, “What is it?”

“Eldest Young Master, there is someone visiting,” came Meng Shanyi’s voice from outside, carrying a strange tone.

“Who is it?” Yang Wei’s eyes flickered. Knowing Meng Shanyi would not disturb him unless the visitor was significant, he wondered what kind of person could cause such an odd tone.

“I think it is Yang Kai.”

“Ninth Brother?” Yang Wei’s voice rose, tinged with disbelief.

Soon the door opened. Yang Wei appeared before Meng Shanyi with a solemn face, hands behind his back. “Is it really Ninth Brother?”

Meng Shanyi smiled wryly. “I didn’t see clearly, but he was accompanied by Senior Ying Jiu. Except when Yang Kai travels, Ying Jiu would not follow.”

Yang Wei’s expression stiffened, nodding. “Since Ying Jiu is here, it must be Ninth Brother.”

He chuckled lightly. “Quite bold action; Ninth Brother remains unpredictable.”

Though he had made friendly gestures during the Treasure Snatching Battle at Po Jing Lake, they were still rivals. Yang Kai dared to come to his residence accompanied only by Ying Jiu—such courage was rare.

“Eldest Young Master, this is an opportunity!” Meng Shanyi’s voice lowered, face eager. “Judging by Yang Kai’s performance since the succession war, he will surely be a stronger enemy than the Second Young Master. Why not take advantage of his solitary intrusion tonight...?”

He made a gesture with his hand.

Yang Wei coldly laughed and slowly shook his head.

“Eldest Young Master!” Meng Shanyi’s tone grew urgent, clearly frustrated that Yang Wei would not seize such a good chance. “Great achievements do not fuss over minor matters! If we do not eliminate him now, we might lose all chances.”

From being overlooked to now having a rising reputation, with victory calls growing louder, Yang Kai’s residence had developed remarkably.

His advantages were steadily increasing and would continue to do so until all enemies were swallowed and he emerged the final victor.

Meng Shanyi seemed to see that day clearly. As an ally of Yang Wei, how could he not be anxious?

But the Eldest Young Master ignored the opportunity, apparently out of concern for brotherly affection—a foolish attitude.

“I have my own plans. No need for more words!” Yang Wei waved his hand and strode away.

Meng Shanyi was frustrated and smiled bitterly. After a moment, his expression hardened, and he quickly disappeared into the darkness...
