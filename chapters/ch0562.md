## Chapter 562 — It's Already Too Late

With the shouts of those people, the atmosphere in front of Yang Kai’s mansion instantly became tense and hostile.

Ye Xinrou sneered coldly, “Yang Kai, just surrender obediently. You’ve already decided to quit the Succession War anyway. Continuing to resist stubbornly benefits neither you nor those around you. If you have any conscience left, you shouldn’t drag them into this. Letting them go here is the best choice.”

Yang Kai’s expression was silent and calm, but anyone could detect that his patience was at its absolute limit. This calm silence felt like the eerie stillness before a raging storm, unsettling and nerve-wracking.

“Need any help?” Li Yuanchun quietly approached Yang Kai and asked in a low voice.

What he hoped to see most at this moment was Yang Kai hastily returning the revered treasures of the overseas sects. But at present, Yang Kai was clearly trapped in a situation with enemies on all sides. Li Yuanchun’s offer was a goodwill gesture, hoping to do Yang Kai a favor — after getting out of this predicament, they could talk properly.

There were seven Divine Roaming Realm masters here, and Li Yuanchun had no ability to contend with them. But if it came to escaping with Yang Kai, he was still capable of doing so, after all, he himself was at that level.

Yang Kai slowly shook his head, politely declining his kindness.

He was fully aware of Li Yuanchun’s motives.

If Yang Kai truly wanted to escape alone, he would never need anyone’s help. At his current level, spreading the Wings of Yang Flame would place the Divine Roaming Realm masters far behind him, collecting dust. But he definitely would not walk away alone.

Their exchange did not escape the notice of the seven members of Fengshen Hall. In fact, upon arriving here, they immediately sensed Li Yuanchun’s presence. As a Divine Roaming Realm master, Li Yuanchun was too conspicuous.

The overseas sects had summoned fifty Divine Roaming Realm masters today, along with one beyond Divine Roaming Realm. This made the seven of Fengshen Hall suspicious and perplexed, unsure of where Yang Kai had found such strong reinforcements.

Moreover, since they did not know the current situation of Meng Wuya and the Earth Demon, although they shouted fiercely, they refrained from striking easily.

The scene froze abruptly.

A sharp eagle cry came from afar, as though greatly frightened, carrying clear warnings and urgency.

Hearing this, Yang Kai’s expression suddenly changed.

The seven of Fengshen Hall were equally solemn as they looked towards the approaching direction of the Golden Feather Eagle.

“It’s too late!” Yang Kai’s face showed a deep helplessness and rage. “They’re already here.”

Only Yang Kai could understand the message the Golden Feather Eagle conveyed.

Hearing this, everyone suddenly realized that Yang Kai’s earlier words were not exaggerations or tricks; the people from Cangyun Evil Land really had already arrived.

Fear crept into their hearts as they stared blankly at Yang Kai, hoping for more information.

“Bilo!” Yang Kai turned to Bilo, who was hiding among the crowd, and shouted angrily, “Didn’t you say they would only arrive here at night?”

“They should,” Bilo replied confusedly. “Considering the Sacred Land’s team’s speed, they should only get here at night.”

“Then why are they already a hundred li away?”

“How should I know?” Bilo snapped back angrily.

A distance of a hundred li was extremely short, especially considering the time lag of the Golden Feather Eagle’s information relay. Now, escaping was probably already impossible.

Ye Xinrou’s expression twisted strangely as she sulked, “The act is quite convincing. At this point, you still want to...”

She stopped mid-sentence, swallowing the rest under the intimidating, hostile gaze from Yang Kai. She simply didn’t have the courage to continue.

“They really came!” Yang Liting suddenly changed expression as he looked up to the horizon.

The other six also looked extremely grim.

Only at this moment did they realize everything Yang Kai said was true.

Following their gaze, everyone was stunned.

At the horizon, a rolling black cloud pressed forward at a terrifying speed. Within the dark cloud, shadowy figures seemed barely visible.

Lightning flashed intermittently, illuminating that sinister sky with a horrific radiance.

A destructive aura followed the advancing black cloud, enveloping War City.

The black cloud oppressed the city as if to crush it…

In an instant, every eye filled with terror.

“It’s the Lightning Shadow King!” Bilo suddenly exclaimed. “Only he could move this fast. Surely he’s brought the others here. Yang Kai, I have to go. If he sees me here, it’ll be hard to explain to the Lord.”

Without waiting for a response, Bilo dashed off hastily.

“Stop her!” Ye Xinrou shouted sharply.

Despite everything, she still tried every means to undermine Yang Kai’s morale.

But no one obeyed her order. Bilo flashed a few times and vanished without a trace.

In the face of imminent disaster, who had time for all this? After all, Bilo was just a maid under Shan Qingluo; even if caught, what use would it be?

Before the other five Evil Kings arrived, this destructive aura alone had already silenced the entire War City.

“Now you believe it, don’t you?” Yang Kai sneered coldly at Ye Xinrou and the seven of Fengshen Hall, a razor-sharp smirk playing at his lips, full of mockery.

The seven’s faces were ashen.

Had they listened to Yang Kai’s warning earlier when Qiu Yimeng and Huo Xingchen went to inform them, they would have been prepared and not caught unawares.

Even during their attempt to stop Yang Kai’s departure, believing his words would not have been too late, at least it would have bought some breathing room.

But now… the enemy was truly upon them. No matter what was said, it was already too late.

Here, seven beyond Divine Roaming Realm masters from the Eight Great Families had gathered, along with two to three hundred Divine Roaming Realm masters. If the people of War City suffered losses, it would be a tremendous blow to all of Zhongdu.

“They must not be allowed to pass!” Yang Liting’s expression grew solemn. “Engage!”

Without hesitation, he vanished in a flash towards the black cloud.

The other six quickly followed. Before leaving, the Huo Family’s portly elder gave Yang Kai a regretful and remorseful glance, his face tinged with faint guilt. Then he sternly instructed Ye Xinrou, “Ye Family young lady, take charge here. Whatever you do, you must ensure the people here retreat safely to Zhongdu.”

“Yes,” Ye Xinrou replied promptly.

The black cloud’s momentum was frightening and swift. Though previously far at the horizon, within moments it had closed to twenty li outside War City. After Yang Liting and the others engaged, it was only ten li from the city.

A cataclysmic battle erupted in an instant.

The black cloud was shattered, revealing three figures within.

One shimmered with crackling electric light. Another was burly, seemingly possessing immense strength. The third sat atop a powerful demonic beast.

Lightning Shadow King, Overlord King, Thunder Beast King!

Though outnumbered three to seven, the seven from the Eight Great Families looked grim while the three from Cangyun Evil Land were composed.

Behind them was a giant spider that bore a human face, bizarre and terrifying.

That human face was exquisitely beautiful, appearing no older than eighteen, with enchanting grace and soft flowing hair. Yet against the massive spider body, it seemed monstrous.

“Spider Mother?” Yang Kai gasped, instantly recognizing the demonic beast. It was the same one he and Shan Qingluo had encountered before.

How did it come here?

“Wow, I’ve never seen such a demonic beast here before,” Shui Ling exclaimed. “But unfortunately, without a Transformation Pool, it will never cultivate a human form.”

“Shopkeeper Meng, what’s your take?” Yang Kai quickly asked Meng Wuya.

“Not optimistic.” Meng Wuya shook his head slowly. Though he couldn’t unleash his strength now, his insight remained. “Among the Eight Great Families’ seven beyond Divine Roaming Realm masters, they rank among the weaker. But the three opponents are very strong. So despite having the numerical advantage, the seven are at a disadvantage and may very well... perish there!”

Yang Kai’s expression darkened.

Meng Wuya’s judgment was no doubt honest. After all, he had fought the seven before and knew their limits. Yang Kai had hoped the seven’s involvement would secure War City’s safety for the time being, but it seemed they could only delay the inevitable.

“Shopkeeper Meng, give me a way out,” Yang Kai said, helplessness creeping onto his face.

“Why are you so sure I can?” Meng Wuya chuckled lightly.

“Your precious disciple is here. If there was real danger, you wouldn’t be so calm,” Yang Kai replied with a bitter smile.

The absolute power gap was not something schemes could fix. Now Yang Kai had no choice but to rely on Meng Wuya.

Meng Wuya glanced around and said gravely, “If you leave now, only about ten percent here can escape. But with me and Brother Ling protecting you, you don’t need to worry. We will lead you out.”

“I want everyone here to be safe,” Yang Kai said firmly.

Meng Wuya grinned, “I knew you’d say that.”

Everyone in the mansion showed a hint of emotion, even the overseas masters were somewhat touched.

Yefang and Hua Duanhun quietly approached Li Yuanchun and asked, “Senior, what should we do?”

Li Yuanchun gazed deeply at Yang Kai, then at Meng Wuya, and said, “Stick with them for now. If things become hopeless, I will take the young man away. You find your own way out.”

Yang Kai’s fate was tied to the lost ancestral treasures of the overseas sects. Li Yuanchun would not allow any mishap to befall him.

“Understood.” Yefang and Hua Duanhun nodded softly, agreeing with Li Yuanchun’s plan.

Meng Wuya continued, “Those three are likely just the vanguard of Cangyun Evil Land. Shortly, more will arrive. Look over there... the Thunder Beast King has brought numerous demonic beasts.”

Following his pointing finger, Yang Kai saw rolling dust tens of li away, innumerable demonic beasts scurrying and flying everywhere. Feeling them out briefly, his face darkened.

These beasts were no weaklings; the lowest were Fifth-Tier, and many were Sixth-Tier demonic beasts.
