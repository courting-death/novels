## Chapter 512 — You Don’t Have the Guts

“It’s meaningless.” Facing Kang Zhan’s inquiry, Nan Sheng gave a cold smile. “What I want to say is, as long as we hold the leverage, even if the four seniors fail, we can still maintain the upper hand. Whether Yang Kai would surrender because of them, I don’t know. Most likely not, but we can retreat safely. Young Master Kang has also witnessed the power of that Mystery-Grade treasure of his. If he’s determined to keep us here, who could stop him?”

Kang Zhan’s expression shifted. He carefully pondered Nan Sheng’s words and found a certain truth in them.

It was obvious that Yang Kai indeed cared deeply about Lingxiao Pavilion’s people; otherwise, he wouldn’t have discussed this matter with him. Given Yang Kai’s nature, if anyone dared to block his path, he probably would have struck without hesitation.

Using these people as leverage to coerce Yang Kai into compliance? At worst, they could withdraw unscathed!

“You don’t still have reservations about the verbal agreement between you and Yang Kai, do you?” Nan Sheng sneered when he saw Kang Zhan’s hesitation.

Kang Zhan’s face darkened, and he did not deny it. Although the agreement was only verbal, for a young master of Zhongdu, keeping one’s promise was of great importance. Since he agreed with Yang Kai not to harm Lingxiao Pavilion’s people, if he reneged, it would be inappropriate.

“Great achievements don’t get bogged down by small matters, Young Master Kang. Do you want to just watch Yang Kai use that treasure to imprison all our people here?” Nan Sheng pressed on while the iron was hot.

Xiang Chu, who had remained silent all this time, also spoke: “Young Master Kang, please reconsider. Perhaps you think what we’re doing is personal revenge. I do not deny harboring extreme hatred towards Yang Kai, but Brother Nan and I are planning for everyone’s sake.”

Drawing a deep breath, Kang Zhan’s hesitation turned into firm resolve. He nodded, saying, “Let it be done.”

He was truly afraid of Yang Kai and had no expectations from the four Divine Roaming Realm masters.

Nan Sheng and Xiang Chu were overjoyed and exhilarated.

Since joining the Succession War, they had finally grasped an opportunity for proper revenge against Yang Kai. Naturally, their hearts were filled with satisfaction.

“Don’t go too far—two captives will suffice,” Kang Zhan frowned and instructed.

“Understood.” Nan Sheng nodded, grinning wickedly as his gaze swept over the Lingxiao Pavilion people. He pointed to one of the previous generation’s disciples, and immediately some men charged to capture him.

That Senior Uncle did not resist; he even restrained the younger disciples from rash actions and shook his head slowly at the crowd.

Their enemy was strong while they were weak. If a fight broke out, it would not be strange for them to be annihilated here. Better to endure for now and keep the peace.

Seeing the Lingxiao Pavilion people offering no resistance, Nan Sheng and Xiang Chu showed disappointment, sneering with contempt, “Cowards!”

Kang Zhan frowned, displeased at their provocation of the Lingxiao Pavilion people but said nothing.

Nan Sheng’s eyes continued hunting through the crowd for suitable targets when suddenly a ruthless gaze landed on him. He sneered coldly and pointed at that person, “Seize him too!”

As his order was given, a Nan Family strong cultivator captured the younger Lingxiao Pavilion disciple.

This young man did not look old, even younger than Yang Kai. His strength was not great, just at True Yuan Realm Fifth Stage, but clearly with good potential.

This was precisely why Nan Sheng had chosen him.

One old and one young disciple of Lingxiao Pavilion were brought before Nan Sheng. The senior disciple looked calm and composed, neither arrogant nor servile. In contrast, the younger one merely chuckled coldly, stubbornly and proudly staring at Nan Sheng.

“Not bad eyes!” Nan Sheng nodded. Suddenly, he raised his hand and slapped out a palm strike.

With a loud smack, a five-finger imprint appeared on the young disciple’s face. A tooth was knocked out, blood spilling from his mouth. His head tilted aside.

He turned his head, still staring at Nan Sheng with that fierce, ruthless look, saying nothing.

Veins bulging on Nan Sheng’s forehead, he was shocked by this youth’s toughness. Annoyed, he slapped him again with a cold sneer: “Ignorant fool!”

Two slaps later, the young disciple’s cheek was swollen, his mouth full of dirty blood, yet his eyes showed no change—not a hint of fear. Only a resolute determination that one could kill but never humiliate.

Kang Zhan was slightly moved, seemingly surprised by this Lingxiao Pavilion disciple’s performance.

“What’s your name?” Kang Zhan asked.

The young disciple shot him a disdainful glance and proudly said, “Su Mu.”

“Su Mu...” Kang Zhan took a deep breath, muttering, then nodded, “Lingxiao Pavilion truly is extraordinary.”

Even an ordinary young disciple possessed such spirit; what about the others? These people, even if killed, probably would never beg for mercy.

For some reason, Kang Zhan was certain of this.

Su Mu sneered, “You can only be tough in front of me. Just wait until Senior Brother Yang comes out, then I’ll show you what toughness really is!”

Kang Zhan’s face darkened. Indeed, as Su Mu said, he dared not be cruel in front of Yang Kai.

Nan Sheng was even more infuriated. He slammed a fierce kick into Su Mu’s knee. Su Mu did not resist, falling to his knees with a thud. In the next instant, Nan Sheng’s palm strikes rained down like a storm.

Kang Zhan hadn’t even had time to stop him before Su Mu received more than a dozen slaps.

The sharp smacks pierced the air like nails on a chalkboard.

None of the Lingxiao Pavilion people moved, though their breathing grew heavier, their eyes glowing red like ravenous beasts, fixating on Nan Sheng.

The silent, tense atmosphere felt like the calm before a storm. Kang Zhan shivered, suddenly bellowing, “Enough!”

Nan Sheng finally stopped and gasped for breath. He grabbed Su Mu’s mouth to silence him, then drew a sharp sword from a companion and pressed it coldly against Su Mu’s throat. “You think I don’t dare kill you?”

“You don’t have the guts.” Despite a mouthful of blood, Su Mu sneered mockingly, as if tired of living.

Nan Sheng’s expression instantly changed, filled with hesitation and struggle. The sword’s blade slowly pressed, cutting open a bloody line on Su Mu’s neck, but Nan Sheng never dared to sever it.

Killing Su Mu wouldn’t be difficult.

But Yang Kai’s inevitable retaliation was the real question—could he withstand it?

Su Mu’s expression was steadfast, showing not the slightest fear. He knew Nan Sheng feared Yang Kai.

“Let him go.” Kang Zhan took a deep breath and shook his head slowly. Despite Nan Sheng’s fierce appearance, he was merely someone who knew how to pick on the weak.

Nan Sheng clenched his fists tightly, teeth gnashing. He wanted to kill this insolent challenger with one stroke but couldn’t bring himself to do it.

Kang Zhan’s words left Nan Sheng in a dilemma. To release Su Mu would mean admitting his own cowardice. As a young master from a First-Class Family, Nan Sheng couldn’t afford that humiliation.

His face turned vicious as his sword arced sharply.

Blood splattered.

Su Mu’s chest was pierced through by the sharp blade.

Nan Sheng’s face twisted with rage as he violently threw Su Mu to the ground.

The Lingxiao Pavilion members were shocked and rushed forward to support him.

“You really think I don’t dare touch you?” Nan Sheng spat, his face twitching.

“You bastard!” Kang Zhan was stunned, then shouted angrily as he kicked Nan Sheng, sending him staggering.

When Nan Sheng had beaten Su Mu earlier, Kang Zhan had barely intervened. After all, external wounds healed in time and could be excused by Yang Kai. But now, with a sword piercing, it could be fatal.

Still, it was clear Nan Sheng had hesitated.

He chose Su Mu’s right chest; if it had been the left, where the heart is, Su Mu might be dead instantly.

Voices rose in outrage and curses from the Lingxiao Pavilion group, many fiercely attacking the Nan and Xiang family warriors nearby.

“Don’t any of you dare resist!” Kang Zhan roared as he rushed to the Nan and Xiang warriors. He quickly took out a jade bottle from his bosom, trembling as he withdrew a pill and stuffed it into Su Mu’s bloody mouth.

During this, Kang Zhan was struck a few times by Lingxiao Pavilion people, but fortunately, his armor provided strong protection so he remained unharmed.

Recognizing his intention, those gathered around Su Mu ceased their attacks, while several Senior Uncles hurried to channel energy to neutralize the pill’s effects.

Suddenly, a crisp sound echoed nearby.

Kang Zhan turned to see the Mystic-Grade middle-level formation sealing array, created by the Mystery-Grade treasure, hum with a sound and dissolve into shimmering light.

The blizzard vanished without a trace.

At the center of the array, Yang Kai and the woman from before appeared, wrapped in a cold wind.

Near them stood four ice-sculpture-like forms, frozen in bizarre poses, standing silently.

They were four experts from the Kang and Qiu families!

From their frozen expressions, one could almost see their disbelief before being encased in ice.

Kang Zhan’s scalp tingled, his feet twitching in nervousness.

Although he vaguely felt that the four Divine Roaming Realm masters couldn’t contain Yang Kai, he never expected such a result.

The warriors surrounding the formation all stepped back, faces filled with shock and fear when they saw Yang Kai and Su Yan.

Among them, few were experts, and even those with Divine Roaming Realm cultivation were only at the fourth or fifth stage.

Strong warriors from the Zhongdu Eight Great Families were frozen solid; who would dare oppose now?

Leading them, Qiu Ziru looked pale, lips trembling, a chilling fear dawning in his heart.

Yang Kai glanced at him calmly. “They won’t die, but if they want to get out, it will take at least half a day.”

Qiu Ziru nodded unconsciously, forcing a smile. “Thank you for your mercy, Ninth Young Master.”

Yang Kai gave a slight nod without further words.

After all, those four were from the Zhongdu Eight Great Families. It was enough to teach them a lesson—wounding them or even crippling them was acceptable, but killing was forbidden.

Sometimes, mercy had to be shown. That was why Yang Kai spared them, trusting even if they broke free, they would need a month or two to recover.
