## Chapter 250 — I Will Play with You

The man was clearly dazed by the misfortune he had brought upon himself, speaking indiscriminately. Upon hearing his words, everyone frowned.

“Watch your mouth!” Shu Xiaoyu stepped forward and scolded. Initially, she felt some sympathy for this person, but seeing him indiscriminately insult even her Senior Brother, that shred of sympathy vanished in an instant.

Chen Xueshu pulled her back, slowly shaking his head at her.

Chen Xueshu had a good temper; he understood that this person had suffered a great blow and had no intention of arguing with him.

However, the man became increasingly aggressive, glaring at Zi Mo and cursing, “You shameless woman, if you can’t think of a way to restore my Dantian, I will make you wish you were dead!”

Zi Mo was not a woman with a good temper either. Having been restrained these past few days, unable to control her own life and death, and having been secretly plotted against by her own sect, she was already filled with pent-up anger. Now, hearing him threaten her, her temper flared. With a cold laugh, she retorted, “Just you? Even if I knew how to save you, I wouldn’t!”

This was merely a retort born of anger, but to her surprise, the man’s expression brightened. He grabbed Bi Xiuming’s arm excitedly and exclaimed, “Senior Brother, did you hear that? She indeed has a way! Quickly, grab her and let her save me! I don’t want to become a cripple!”

Bi Xiuming’s expression shifted between dark and light. After a moment, he slowly nodded and comforted, “Alright, if she dares not save you, I will cripple her cultivation and make her your maid for life!”

With that, he slowly stood up, turning to glare at Zi Mo with a gloomy expression.

Zi Mo’s beautiful face revealed a glint of killing intent as she coldly stared back.

“What is this about?” Chen Xueshu stepped forward to mediate. “Bi Xiuming, you should know that what this young lady just said was merely in anger. Besides, she has saved our lives. If it weren’t for her and Yang Kai’s collaboration in putting on a good show, we would still be under the control of Yao He and Yao Xi. You should be grateful, not seek to harm her!”

“Saved our lives?” Bi Xiuming sneered. “If it weren’t for her attacking with those two Tianlang thieves earlier, how would we have ended up as prisoners? She saved us? That was merely her self-preservation tactic! She only saved herself. Chen Xueshu, I know you have a good temper, but don’t meddle in this matter!”

Chen Xueshu frowned. Although he did not like Bi Xiuming, he had to admit that what Bi Xiuming said was indeed the truth!

Zi Mo had led the Demonic Beasts to attack everyone here. They had been controlled by Yao He and Yao Xi, and Zi Mo bore a significant responsibility. When she had teamed up with Yang Kai to slay Yao He and Yao Xi, it was indeed only out of self-preservation. She had no intention of saving anyone.

Knowing that Bi Xiuming was speaking the truth made Chen Xueshu feel somewhat awkward. On one hand, he did not like Zi Mo. On the other hand, he knew that Zi Mo and Yang Kai had come together, and there must be some bond between them, making it difficult to help either side.

With such concerns, the others felt the same. Whether it was the four young women from Wan Hua Palace or Senior Sister Zhou Ba and Ye Qingsi, they all remained silent, choosing not to help either side and quietly observing the situation.

No one understood the relationship between Yang Kai and Zi Mo.

Seeing countless eyes turned toward him, Yang Kai sneered and fixed his gaze on Bi Xiuming. “You want to cripple her cultivation and make her your Junior Brother’s maid?”

With someone trying to harm Zi Mo, he naturally could not stand by idly. After all, Zi Mo was currently under his control.

“If she cannot restore my Junior Brother to his former state, then that will be her fate!” Bi Xiuming’s expression was dark.

“Your Junior Brother probably doesn’t have that fortune!” Yang Kai smiled indifferently. “She is already my maid!”

Zi Mo’s chest heaved! Yet she found it hard to refute. To say she was Yang Kai’s maid was already an overstatement; her life and death were in Yang Kai’s hands, so what could she say?

Though she gritted her teeth in anger, Zi Mo felt that this man was so detestable that she couldn’t bring herself to hate him. Because this person was standing up for her.

The others were taken aback by this statement. They were astonished to see that Zi Mo did not refute it. One by one, they widened their eyes, looking at Zi Mo and then at Yang Kai, filled with disbelief.

These people had fallen into the hands of Yao He and Yao Xi, living in humiliation and suffering, yet the relationship between Yang Kai and Zi Mo was completely reversed. What was going on? How did he achieve this?

A strange expression flashed across Leng Shan’s face. Strictly speaking, her status was the same as Zi Mo’s.

“My maid, her life and death can only be decided by me. You don’t have that qualification yet.” Yang Kai had long been displeased with Bi Xiuming, and this was the perfect opportunity to vent his frustrations.

“Ha ha…” Bi Xiuming sneered, looking at Yang Kai with disdain. “It seems you are so enchanted by this Tianlang woman that you don’t even know which side you should stand on. Speaking up for her like this, have you become her underling? It’s no wonder; this woman is clearly a vixen, a whore for all, letting you play with her a few times isn’t a loss.”

The women all frowned. Bi Xiuming’s words were too crude and difficult to accept for anyone.

Zi Mo’s face turned pale with anger, her delicate body trembling. Although she appeared promiscuous, her words and actions often gave that impression, only those who truly understood her knew she was a not yet a woman.

“Get out of my way! I want to kill him!” Zi Mo gritted her teeth, glaring at Bi Xiuming with venomous eyes, her expression icy.

Having been humiliated to this extent, there was no room for reconciliation.

“You can’t make a move!” Yang Kai shot her a cold glance. After all, she was a Tianlang person. Even if she was stronger than Bi Xiuming, she could defeat him, but once she engaged Bi Xiuming, the Great Han people would not sit idly by, and things would become very difficult to handle.

“I don’t care! I want him dead!” Zi Mo was somewhat frantic, her True Essence raging within her.

“Get away!” Yang Kai shouted angrily.

Zi Mo was momentarily stunned, her anger subsiding considerably. She was clever and understood Yang Kai’s concerns. Leng Shan, observing the situation, hurriedly stepped forward to pull Zi Mo away. Both of them had endured the torment of their souls and understood Yang Kai’s temperament. If they truly went against his wishes, they would likely suffer another round of torment.

Bi Xiuming’s cold gaze remained fixed on Zi Mo, his face filled with eagerness.

“Senior Brother, we can’t let her go!” Bi Xiuming’s Junior Brother shouted from the side.

A look of determination flashed in Bi Xiuming’s eyes as he slightly nodded. Just as he was about to charge at Zi Mo, Yang Kai stepped in front of him.

“I will play with you!” Yang Kai looked at him with a calm expression.

Bi Xiuming frowned, disgust evident on his face. “You’re really willing to go against me for a Tianlang woman?”

“I said, she is my maid, and her life and death can only be decided by me.”

“You are not my opponent; I don’t want to kill you.” Bi Xiuming’s face was filled with impatience.

“How do you know if you haven’t fought?” Yang Kai stood like a rock.

Bi Xiuming scrutinized Yang Kai deeply, and after a moment, he disdainfully nodded. “Fine, since you seek death, don’t blame me. I will kill you first and then find trouble with that demon girl!”

As he spoke, Bi Xiuming fiercely launched a palm strike at Yang Kai. True Essence surged, and the palm wind howled.

A gasp arose from the crowd. No one expected Bi Xiuming to attack so suddenly! He was a True Essence Realm Fourth Stage martial artist, while Yang Kai was merely a Separation and Union Realm Eighth Stage martial artist. With such a lethal move, how could Yang Kai possibly survive?

Did he not care that Yang Kai had just saved him? This man had clearly lost his mind in anger, showing no sense of morality.

“Show mercy!” Han Xiao Qi cried out in alarm.

Ye Qingsi had already rushed over, enveloped in a shroud of blood light.

Zi Mo and Leng Shan couldn’t help but gasp, their mouths agape in shock.

In the blink of an eye, Yang Kai raised his palm to clash with Bi Xiuming.

The collision of Yuan Qi unleashed a torrent of energy.

Bi Xiuming involuntarily staggered back, retreating several steps before barely stabilizing himself, while Yang Kai remained unfazed.

Ye Qingsi, who had rushed over, halted in her tracks. The blood light on her body flickered, her expression filled with astonishment.

Zi Mo and Leng Shan were equally wide-eyed, filled with disbelief.

Zhou Ba, like an iron tower, squinted his eyes, his knife-like face twitching slightly.

Chen Xueshu and Shu Xiaoyu both formed round shapes with their mouths, feeling somewhat oxygen-deprived.

…

Everyone reacted differently, but they were equally shocked that Yang Kai could repel Bi Xiuming with a single palm strike.

Separation and Union Realm Eighth Stage, True Essence Realm Fourth Stage…

Not to mention the five minor realms of difference. But there was a significant major realm gap in between!

Before the True Yuan Realm, the martial artist’s Yuan Qi was merely Yuan Qi, but after reaching the True Yuan Realm, what resided within the martial artist was True Yuan!

The two were not on the same level at all. No Separation and Union Realm martial artist had ever repelled a True Essence Realm expert at this level, except for those exceedingly rare prodigies.

And now, this shocking scene was unfolding right before their eyes.

Bi Xiuming stared at Yang Kai in shock, his left hand clutching his right. He desperately urged his True Essence to dissolve the True Yang Yuan Qi invading his body, but his right hand was already turning crimson, as if it were on fire, and the redness was visibly spreading up his arm.

“Your Yuan Qi…” Bi Xiuming’s voice trembled, “How could it be so pure?”

Yang Kai sneered, his footwork unfolding as he created an afterimage, instantly closing in on Bi Xiuming, a massive hand descending from above.

Bi Xiuming exclaimed in alarm, hurriedly raising both palms to defend.

Cloud Parting Palm! The palm wind could part clouds and mist, an Earth-Grade Upper-Level martial skill of remarkable power!

Yang Kai met it with a single palm. A crisp sound echoed, and Bi Xiuming’s body immediately shrank down a notch. Yang Kai was also slightly jolted back, but he steadied his footing, gathering his energy in his Dantian and launching a punch.

Bi Xiuming was unable to defend against this relentless barrage of fierce attacks. This punch landed directly on his chest.

Triple Flame Yang Explosion!

More than a month ago, Yang Kai had battled Qi Jianxing, and the Triple Flame Yang Explosion had been perfectly countered by the True Essence Realm Third Stage Qi Jianxing, failing to injure him even a bit. But at this moment, Bi Xiuming, a True Essence Realm Fourth Stage martial artist, did not possess that capability.

Firstly, Yang Kai’s Yuan Qi had become much purer compared to a month ago, all thanks to the Liuyan Liquid.

Secondly, Qi Jianxing hailed from the prestigious Jiu Xing Sword Sect, while Bi Xiuming’s sect was merely a second-rate one, and their foundations were vastly different.

With the balance shifted, the Triple Flame Yang Explosion erupted violently within Bi Xiuming’s body. He let out a miserable scream, his face turning pale as he involuntarily spat out a mouthful of blood.
