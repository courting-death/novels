## Chapter 25 — The Subtle Use of the Incense Burner

Xia Ningshang entered the Contribution Hall and glanced furtively behind her, noticing that Yang Kai had already left. She quietly breathed a sigh of relief. The events of the morning still left her feeling somewhat guilty, as if she were a thief caught in the act.

Just as her mind was tangled in confusion, she heard Shopkeeper Meng sighing deeply from behind the counter.

“What’s the matter, Master?” Xia Ningshang asked.

“I’m lamenting over that boy just now,” Shopkeeper Meng said with a heavy heart. “He’s a good child, hardworking and enduring, with a decent character and a temper that’s not bad at all…”

Hearing her master praise Yang Kai so highly, Xia Ningshang’s anger flared. She thought to herself, *You don’t even know what he did to your disciple this morning—he stripped her naked, defiling her eyes, and scared her half to death.*

Shopkeeper Meng continued speaking without pause, and the more Xia Ningshang listened, the angrier she became. Suddenly, she slammed her hand down on the counter.

A sharp cracking sound rang out.

Shopkeeper Meng looked down, his face twisting in anguish as he let out a heart-wrenching wail, “My Earth-Grade Low-Level Blood Spirit Ganoderma worth twenty Contribution Points…”

“Blood Spirit Ganoderma?” Xia Ningshang looked at the powder now scattered across the table and wondered if her master’s eyesight was failing. This didn’t look like Blood Spirit Ganoderma at all.

“No, no, I must have been mistaken,” Shopkeeper Meng said, blowing lightly on the powder. The dust was swept away as if caught by an invisible hand, drifting outside without a trace.

“By the way, what brings you to see me today?” Shopkeeper Meng adjusted his expression, unusually serious.

“I’ve broken through,” Xia Ningshang replied.

Shopkeeper Meng’s expression shifted slightly as he carefully examined her cultivation realm, nodding repeatedly. “Very good. I was right—only someone with your constitution truly suits this technique. Here, take this pill; it will stabilize your realm.”

“Thank you,” Xia Ningshang accepted it, hesitating briefly before softly asking, “Master, how is your injury?”

Shopkeeper Meng smiled faintly. “No need to worry about me. I’ve been through so much over the years; it’s nothing serious.”

Yang Kai returned to his small wooden hut with a mixture of excitement and anticipation.

Now that the Three-Leaf Remnant Soul Flowers and Desolate Deadwood Herbs were prepared in sufficient quantities, they should last for quite some time.

With everything ready, only the crucial moment remained. Yang Kai was eager to discover whether the incense burner could truly aid his cultivation.

The hut was located in the most remote and desolate part of Lingxiao Pavilion, rarely visited by anyone. Thus, Yang Kai had no fear of exposing his secret. He entered, summoned the Wordless Black Book, flipped to the third page, and took out the incense burner, placing it beside the bed.

He then took out the Three-Leaf Remnant Soul Flowers and Desolate Deadwood Herbs, stuffing both into the burner before sealing it with the lid.

In an instant, a faint, unusual fragrance filled the hut. Yang Kai inhaled deeply, focusing his senses. Although the scent was peculiar, there was nothing particularly noteworthy about it, and he felt no immediate effect after breathing it in.

However, from the holes in the incense burner’s lid, the aroma continuously streamed forth, invading Yang Kai’s nostrils like slender snakes, eerie and relentless, entering through his mouth and nose into his body.

Suddenly, it felt as though something had entered his flesh, his meridians, even his marrow. A tingling numbness spread throughout his entire body.

Yang Kai dared not delay. He hurriedly took the incense burner and stepped outside, preparing to cultivate.

The moment he took his first step, he was shocked. His foot felt as if filled with lead, unbearably heavy. With that step, his physical strength began to drain rapidly.

Taking a second step, he felt utterly exhausted, cold sweat pouring down his body. His muscles tensed, and the qi he had just cultivated throbbed wildly through his meridians. His bones cracked audibly.

On the third step, his legs suddenly gave way, and he collapsed to his knees, the incense burner rolling far from his grasp.

Supporting himself with both hands on the ground, Yang Kai remained as still as a mountain, but his heavy breathing was like a broken bellows. His chest heaved violently, his flesh convulsed, and his tendons, organs, and bones swelled and contracted repeatedly. The tingling sensation intensified. Yang Kai wanted to shout but suppressed it with all his might.

His current state was clearly one of extreme fatigue, a condition he had experienced several times before and was somewhat familiar with.

But he had only taken three steps—how could all his strength be completely drained? Not only his physical strength but his spirit was utterly exhausted, as if he had gone days without sleep. Fatigue overwhelmed him, and his vision blurred.

In truth, his vital energy and spirit had plummeted to their lowest point; he did not even have the strength to move a finger.

At that moment, the medicinal effects of the Three-Leaf Remnant Soul Flower and Desolate Deadwood Herb flashed through Yang Kai’s mind.

Both herbs carried mild toxins, not potent enough to harm most people even if consumed in quantity. However, the former harmed the spirit, while the latter damaged the body. Considering his current condition, Yang Kai began to understand.

It was likely that inhaling the incense’s fragrance caused this reaction. Yet neither herb alone could produce such a strong effect. The secret must lie within the incense burner itself, which amplified the herbs’ medicinal properties infinitely.

Having obtained the Proud Bone Golden Body, Yang Kai’s recovery was extremely rapid. On that day, after cultivating for a long time, he had not felt fatigued and thus had not reached his limit. Without reaching his limit, he could not force out his true potential.

But now was different. Simply taking three steps left him utterly exhausted. He had reached his limit with ease. How could he fear being unable to cultivate in the future?

Yang Kai firmly believed that human potential was limitless; the key was how to unlock it. While innate talent influenced a martial artist’s growth, personal effort was indispensable. Therefore, despite knowing his own mediocre talent, he had never ceased his diligent cultivation over the years.

With this thought, Yang Kai’s spirit surged.

He gradually summoned strength in his hands, pushing up his exhausted body. His thighs trembled violently, veins bulging, eyes bloodshot with determination. Inch by inch, he lifted himself.

Nearly all his strength had been drained, his consciousness fading, yet a fierce resolve erupted within him—a desire to win like never before.

Stand up! Wherever you fall, rise from there! Standing up means breaking through limits, means victory!

Time had never passed so slowly. After the span of a tea cup, Yang Kai had only half risen, his feet trembling as they touched the ground. His legs wobbled like a drunkard’s, but his resolve to stand remained unwavering, slow but unyielding.

Finally, accompanied by a roar of fury, Yang Kai straightened his body. Though he staggered slightly, his footing was firm and resolute.
