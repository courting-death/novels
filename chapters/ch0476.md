## Chapter 476 — A Rat Seeing a Cat?

Tao Yang had not harbored much hope; he only feigned humility in asking for advice so as not to anger this expert.

But after talking with him for a while, Tao Yang’s expression grew grave. He realized this middle-aged man was indeed not specialized in the path of refining artifacts. It was likely that he rarely personally refined weapons, yet some of the techniques and knowledge he possessed far exceeded Tao Yang’s own understanding and insights—these were things unheard of, transcending current refining standards.

This revelation shocked not only Tao Yang but also Wu Yan, who had previously regarded the matter somewhat dismissively; Wu Yan finally became serious and listened attentively.

Half an hour later, Wu Yan could no longer hold back and joined the discussion, presenting his opinions on refining techniques. The Di family expert remained calm and explained everything with a light and unperturbed manner...

In War City, inside Yang Kai’s residence, in Senior Sister’s room, Yang Kai took a deep breath. The bone shield in his hand finally transformed into a streak of light and vanished into his body.

Refining a Mystery-Grade treasure had consumed Yang Kai five full days. This was only possible because the continuous supply of True Yang Primordial Qi never ceased. For other martial artists at the same level, refining a Mystery-Grade treasure would require at least ten to fifteen days.

As the bone shield entered his body, Yang Kai immediately grasped its construction and function. After frowning in deep thought for a moment, he finally smiled slightly, clearly satisfied.

Truly worthy of being a Mystery-Grade treasure, its potential was considerable. If used properly, it could be a deadly weapon.

The reason Yang Kai chose to refine the bone shield first instead of the mirror or the small sword was deliberate.

The mirror was a rank higher than the bone shield and would undoubtedly require much more time to refine. The small sword was a Divine Soul treasure, and although Yang Kai’s Divine Sense was powerful now, he lacked a Sea of Consciousness, so refining it would be extremely difficult.

Thus, the bone shield naturally became his first choice.

With the bone shield now incorporated, the runic arrays engraved upon it and the profound laws contained in the Mystery-Grade treasure offered sudden enlightenment to Yang Kai. Unconsciously, his cultivation in the Eighth Stage of the True Essence Realm leapt forward.

Yang Kai estimated that if he refined the mirror next, he could definitely ascend to the Ninth Stage of the True Essence Realm.

With increased strength, breaking through the current bottleneck would no longer be solely about amassing power; more importantly, it would require the refinement of one’s temperament and a deeper understanding of the Martial Arts.

Once the latter two reach the required level, the accumulation of power would become effortless.

While examining the wondrous mystique of the bone shield, Yang Kai suddenly sensed a wave of disturbance in his mind. His expression involuntarily changed as he suddenly looked up toward the door, beaming with joy.

“The old bastard has finally shown himself!” Yang Kai grinned widely, slowly stood up, and opened the door to step out.

“Young Master!” Ying Jiu appeared ghost-like.

Yang Kai glanced at him coolly. Scanning him with Divine Sense, he noticed Ying Jiu had fully recovered. Satisfied, he nodded without further words and said, “Cultivate on your own. I have no use for you for now.”

“Yes!” Ying Jiu’s figure gradually faded into the Primordial Qi.

He was somewhat surprised himself, not expecting Yang Kai to be completely unfazed by his current condition, as if he had already foreseen that Meng Wuya could break the Sealing Yuan Curse’s seal.

Suddenly, the door to the adjacent room opened. Meng Wuya emerged with a solemn expression, staring into a certain direction in the void.

“There is demonic energy!” Shopkeeper Meng said, casting a glance at Yang Kai. “And it feels somewhat familiar.”

“You have seen it before,” Yang Kai smiled.

Meng Wuya frowned, squinting. “Is it that demon?”

“Correct,” Yang Kai nodded slightly.

Back then at Dragon Confinement Ravine, Meng Wuya had pulled the Earth Demon spirit out of Yang Kai’s body in one move. They had even quarreled verbally at the time. Though Meng Wuya held the overwhelming advantage over the Earth Demon spirit, Yang Kai had keenly sensed that Meng Wuya feared the Earth Demon somewhat.

“Since it is him, I will not intervene further. Let him come and meet me,” Meng Wuya said lightly.

Yang Kai was stunned but nodded gently.

“Little Yang Kai, don’t blame me for being meddlesome. You’d better stay cautious of that demon. He’s not as simple as you think.”

“I know.”

“Also, make him behave. There are eight top experts from Zhongdu’s Eight Great Families monitoring War City. His arrival surely has alerted them.”

Yang Kai felt a headache coming on. The eight Divine Roaming experts seated at War City monitored all directions. The Earth Demon’s aura could not be concealed from them. Though under Yang Kai’s protection, if the Earth Demon acted recklessly, those eight would surely not stand by idly.

After a few exchanges, Meng Wuya returned inside.

Yang Kai sighed helplessly and stepped out to greet the visitor. He was very curious what the Earth Demon had been up to these past months.

Moreover, he sensed not only the Earth Demon but also Leng Shan’s soul fluctuation among the newcomers.

Since Leng Shan had come, the Ghost King Valley people must have come as well—something Yang Kai had not anticipated.

On the way, Yang Kai met a martial artist from an unknown faction and ordered, “Go and bring Qiu Yimeng here!”

“Yes,” the man responded and hurried off to find Qiu Yimeng.

As they approached the gate, the young lady Qiu Yimeng appeared in time, a hint of suspicion on her face: “What’s going on?”

“Receiving someone,” Yang Kai replied.

“Receiving someone?” Qiu Yimeng frowned, then her face brightened. “Is there someone coming to join us?”

“Something like that,” Yang Kai nodded calmly.

Qiu Yimeng smiled at him. Though she did not know how he knew, since he said so, it surely was true. She pursed her lips. “More people coming is good; our strength will grow stronger.”

“This time the visitors are somewhat different. You must arrange carefully, and prevent conflicts with other clan forces in the residence. Pay close attention.”

“What do you mean?” Qiu Yimeng did not understand. Previously, no matter who came—whether super factions, first-rate families, or second-rate sects—Yang Kai treated all equally, neither looking down on nor favoring anyone. This equality made everyone in the residence comfortable.

But now, he actually asked her to pay special attention to this group. Qiu Yimeng wondered what sort of different relationship they might have with Yang Kai to warrant such caution.

“They come from Cangyun Evil Land. That should make it clear,” Yang Kai said with a glance.

Two female figures appeared in Qiu Yimeng’s mind—one a bewitchingly mature beauty, the other a naked girl with milky liquid dripping from her mouth. She exclaimed, “Is it that Queen bringing them?”

“No, they are from Ghost King Valley,” Yang Kai shook his head.

Qiu Yimeng was stunned but then nodded slightly: “I understand.”

Coming from Cangyun Evil Land meant they were disciples of an evil sect. They might have had grievances with the forces in the residence. If not handled well, it could cause trouble at home.

But when did this despicable man have connections with Ghost King Valley?

Once again, Qiu Yimeng was moved by how broad Yang Kai’s circle of friends was.

Not long after, a large contingent approached the residence—more than thirty people. Qiu Yimeng’s face brightened with delight.

Yang Kai stood quietly with hands behind his back, his gaze scanning the middle-aged man leading the group, a faint smile on his lips.

Behind him stood several Ghost King Valley disciples whom Yang Kai had met during the trial at Bloodthirsty Evil Cave—all present.

But what surprised and excited Yang Kai the most was the presence of members from Baoqi Sect!

After the succession war began, Yang Kai had dispatched messengers from Bamboo Segment Gang to send messages out. Senior Sister had immediately come upon receiving the notice.

Baoqi Sect had not responded until now; the other forces in the residence were all gathered by Yang Kai himself, not summoned!

Yet now Tao Yang and others had finally appeared; Yang Kai felt a great weight lifted from his heart. His only mystery was why these three groups had come together.

What puzzled him even more was that both the Ghost King Valley and Baoqi Sect members treated the Earth Demon leading the group with utmost respect.

What had the Earth Demon done? Yang Kai frowned.

It seemed the Earth Demon was a little excited after such a long absence, striding forward. Before the crowd, he could not expose his relationship with Yang Kai, so he cupped his fists and said, “Young Master, I’ve been dying to see you!”

Yang Kai snorted coldly, “I thought you would never come looking for me again in this lifetime!”

The Earth Demon’s face twisted in embarrassment and hurriedly said, “No, I rushed here, though I met some accidents before, hehe!”

“We’ll talk about your matters later,” Yang Kai shot him a stern look.

The Earth Demon felt great relief and stepped forward, standing beside Yang Kai. He smiled at Qiu Yimeng with approval, inwardly praising her appearance and thinking she was qualified to warm the young master’s bed.

Qiu Yimeng smiled faintly and saluted the Earth Demon. Although she found him somewhat unpleasant, he was here to help Yang Kai after all.

Meanwhile, the Ghost King Valley and Baoqi Sect people stood dumbfounded.

Throughout the journey, both factions had fully witnessed the Earth Demon’s strength and mystery. After he blew a black mist at the Ghost King Seal spirit, it fell into deep slumber and was on the verge of evolving. Baoqi Sect’s Wu Yan no longer looked down on the Earth Demon, showing great respect both in demeanor and words.

Yet such a mysterious and powerful person, vicious and ruthless in his methods, gave them, upon meeting Yang Kai, a feeling like... a rat seeing a cat.

What was going on?

No one could understand.

“Brother Yang, long time no see!” After a moment’s daze, the Ghost King Valley crowd and Tao Yang stepped forward to greet.

“Thank you for your kindness,” Yang Kai glanced at them. “The journey was tough. Nothing unusual encountered on the way, right?”

He cast a wary glance at the Earth Demon, fearing he might do something earth-shattering.

“No, no. Just minor troubles. Thanks to Senior Di Mo’s help, we arrived safely,” they all replied in unison.

One does not speak ill of a villain, especially not of one who has saved your life.
