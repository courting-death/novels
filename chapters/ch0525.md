## Chapter 525 — All Have Arrived

Under the watchful gaze of all, the Earth Demon spoke recklessly, boasting arrogantly in front of those beyond the Divine Roaming Realm, drawing everyone’s attention.

"Nonsense!" Yang Liting coldly snorted, waving his hand to strike out a palm.

Under that palm strike, the Earth Demon involuntarily crouched down, almost falling to his knees, yet he still stubbornly held himself up. However, the Blood Demon puppet beside him suddenly exploded, vanishing without a trace just like Xiang Chu.

A flicker of cold light suddenly bloomed in the Earth Demon’s eyes as he glared icy at Yang Liting.

“Hm?” The eight members beyond the Divine Roaming Realm were all momentarily stunned. None of them expected the Earth Demon to possess such strong resilience. Even though Yang Liting hadn’t delivered his full strength in that strike, it was still an attack no master at the Divine Roaming Realm could withstand easily. At the very least, the opponent should have suffered broken bones, coughed up blood, or fallen heavily injured.

Yet, the Earth Demon had only lowered his stance — something not even possible for a Divine Roaming Realm practitioner.

Though Yang Liting had long disliked the Earth Demon, as one standing among the pinnacle, he could not lose face by continuing after a failed attack. Instead, he coldly snorted and no longer paid him any mind.

The Earth Demon sneered maliciously, his eyes darkening dangerously as they stared at Yang Liting.

The Blood Demon puppet was difficult to forge, and to be instantly pulverized by Yang Liting’s palm infuriated him deeply.

Considering Yang Kai’s current state and predicament, the Earth Demon had no choice but to swallow his anger and avoid further entanglement.

“Senior Yang…” Qiu Yimeng cautiously called out, nervously pursing her dry lips. “Yang Kai is breaking through right now. If you have any advice, could you please tell this junior now? I will be sure to relay it afterward!”

She had discerned some of Yang Liting’s thoughts but dared not confirm, only using this excuse to buy Yang Kai some time, hoping Yang Liting would consider their blood ties and not act too harshly.

But Yang Liting paid no mind and kept his icy gaze fixed on Yang Kai, who was currently immersed in the Baptism of heavenly and earthly power, expression as cold as before.

Since Yang Kai’s consciousness had delved deeply into his Proud Bone Golden Body, the evil energy within had been continuously surging outwards without pause. At this moment, not only did it not lessen, but it increasingly intensified.

Yang Liting furrowed his brows tightly, and the expressions of the other seven beyond the Divine Roaming Realm also darkened.

“Brother Yang, this kid really seems to have fallen into demonic deviation!” the pudgy elder sighed. “Such a pity for such a promising young talent.”

He had already instructed Yang Liting to stop Yang Kai’s rampage, but Yang Liting had refused to listen. Now, it was too late to reverse the course.

“But how can he have such a vast amount of evil energy inside?” another frowned, clearly puzzled.

A True Yuan Realm practitioner at the ninth stage could not possibly hold so much True Yuan. His dantian and meridians were not bottomless pits. This tremendous energy rivaled that of a peak Divine Roaming Realm master—and it was still spurting out.

“It looks like he has practiced evil arts for quite some time,” a dark-faced elder said gravely. Then he turned to Yang Liting: “Brother Yang, what are you going to do? Make up your mind quickly. If you let him go on like this, the tens of thousands in War City might all be corrupted by the demonic path. Though he is blood of the Yang Family, we cannot allow him to bring devastation upon the living.”

“No need for your input!” Yang Liting snorted coldly, as if he had already made up his mind.

“Senior, what exactly do you intend?” Qiu Yimeng stepped forward anxiously, her heart increasingly uneasy and worried.

Qiu Daoren frowned before slowly reaching out a hand, sweeping an invisible force that bound and dragged Qiu Yimeng over to him.

“Grand Elder…” Qiu Yimeng’s face turned pale.

“Do not meddle in Yang Family affairs!” Qiu Daoren shook his head, injecting energy into her body. Qiu Yimeng immediately stiffened, unable to move or speak, only able to watch helplessly, her eyes brimming with panic and distress.

“You, shut up as well!” The Divine Roaming master from the Huo Family promptly did the same when Huo Xingchen, impulsive and reckless, was about to speak. He was pulled aside and restrained.

Huo Xingchen rolled his eyes.

The young lords and ladies from the Eight Great Families of Yang Kai’s household immediately lost all voice. The others instantly realized the situation was grim.

Clearly, these eight intended to do something to Yang Kai; otherwise, they would not behave so.

“Brother Yang, no time to waste. If you plan to move, do so now,” someone urged impatiently. Sitting in Fengshen Hall, focused solely on their cultivation and hoping to glimpse a higher realm in their lifetime, they were displeased by Yang Kai’s disturbance that forced them to intervene.

Not everyone sympathized with Yang Kai’s plight like the pudgy elder.

Yang Liting lightly nodded, then glanced at the young leaders gathered not far from Yang Kai and said, “Everyone, step aside!”

At this critical moment, Dong Fatty stepped forward. Though his face was somewhat chubby and tense, he firmly stood in front of Yang Kai, neither servile nor arrogant, and respectfully inquired, “Senior, please tell us what you intend.”

The Hu sisters also stepped forward, standing beside Dong Qinghan, gazing sternly at Yang Liting.

The four young women from Wan Hua Palace, Luo Xiaoman from Ziwei Valley, Zuo Fang from Wen Xin Palace, Chu Jingshan from Fei Yu Pavilion, and the five Divine Roaming Realm masters of the Duanmu Family—all had stepped forward and lined up.

The eight masters beyond the Divine Roaming Realm were astonished. They did not expect Yang Kai to have such good connections, that at such a critical moment, people still dared to speak up for him.

They were certain that if Qiu Yimeng and Huo Xingchen had not been held back, the two would have been among that group — and would very likely have been the ones leading it.

Yang Liting did not become angry but nodded gently and patiently said, “I want to stop his advancement!”

Everyone’s expression changed drastically. Dong Qinghan asked in horror, “Why?”

If Yang Kai’s breakthrough was halted here, his cultivation might be completely ruined, reduced to an ordinary man. Falling from the peak of the Cloud Summit to the world’s lowest would be unbearable for anyone.

Yang Liting slowly shook his head. “He has already slipped into demonic deviation. Once he breaks into the Divine Roaming Realm, he will only become a monster like that one.” He pointed at the Earth Demon as he continued, “Our Eight Great Families have sworn enmity with the demonic fiends; we cannot allow such a person within our clan!”

“That’s just your speculation, isn’t it?” Dong Qinghan frowned.

Yang Liting’s expression darkened instantly, and he coldly snorted: “This is the experience of myself and the others, and what has happened before!”

In the Eight Great Families, it was not unheard of that some cultivated evil arts. Every one of these people, as their strength grew, would gradually change in mentality. The stronger they became, the more malevolent they turned. Once such a person appeared, the Eight Great Families would destroy them or exhaust their cultivation before they could fully mature, avoiding future disaster.

“What happened before does not mean it will happen this time!” Dong Qinghan’s emotion flared. Just because of this, these eight were daring to harm Yang Kai at such a critical moment?

He absolutely could not accept it!

“I am not here to argue with you, nor do you have the qualifications!” Yang Liting’s patience had reached its limits. The explanation just now was only out of respect for their loyalty toward Yang Kai.

Yet now, this group of young people had stood before him, blocking him from purging the traitor. How could he not be furious?

“I believe Yang Kai can control his mind and not fall to the demonic path,” Dong Qinghan loudly declared.

“We believe so too!” the Hu sisters chimed in simultaneously.

“So do we…” came the chorus in unison, stirring everyone’s hearts slightly.

Yang Zhao was instantly dazed.

The forces under his command outnumbered Yang Kai’s several times over! Yet, if he were in Yang Kai’s position, those followers would not be as unwaveringly loyal as Dong Qinghan and the Hu sisters.

His relationship with those forces was merely tied to future interests.

But Ninth Brother’s side appeared to have genuine friends who could share hardships.

Realizing this, Yang Zhao bitterly swallowed his resentment and looked at the black energy-enshrouded, unconscious Yang Kai, his eyes revealing envy.

He too desired such friends.

Yang Wei frowned, bowed and said, “Grand Elder, Ninth Brother was also afflicted by the demonic energy just now, but from what I saw, he remained quite clear-headed and did not lose himself. Perhaps…”

“There’s no place for you to speak!” Yang Liting cut him off coldly.

“Understood.” Yang Wei had no choice but to fall silent.

“If you truly want to destroy Yang Kai, you will have to get past us first!” Dong Qinghan took a deep breath, stabilizing his expression, resolute not to back down.

The others echoed his sentiment.

Qiu Yimeng, still imprisoned, let tears well up in her eyes, feeling both comforted and gratified as she looked at them.

Huo Xingchen was also moved, his blood boiling with passion.

To describe the current situation as a mantis trying to stop a chariot was apt, yet for some reason, this seemingly foolhardy resistance deeply moved Young Master Huo. He wished he could stand there himself, loud and passionate, knowing the path courted death yet still resolutely unwavering.

Suddenly, Young Master Huo felt rather foolish.

“Just you all?” Yang Liting shook his head slowly, his expression indifferent.

He existed beyond the Divine Roaming Realm, and though their numbers were not few, to stop him from acting was but a fantasy.

“If they’re not enough, what if we join them?” a loud shout sounded, and seven figures swiftly flew over.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Like meteors falling from the sky, those seven landed with wild ferocity, lining up and blocking in front of Dong Qinghan and his group.

Dong Fatty’s eyes brightened as his tense mood slightly eased.

For these seven were none other than the seven Blood Servants of Yang Kai’s household prohibited from participating in the Succession War!

Led by Tu Feng, accompanied by Qu Gaoyi, Xiao Shun, Luo Hai, Yan Lingxing, Wu Ju, and Fu Cong—none was missing; all had come.
