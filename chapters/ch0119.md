## Chapter 119 — Returning to the Sect

“They are from the Blood Battle Gang and Fengyu Tower,” Yang Kai said with a grave expression, recounting the events of that night in broad strokes. Naturally, he glossed over how he had single-handedly defeated nine opponents—such a tale was too incredible, and he doubted that Old Meng would believe it even if told plainly.

Meng Wuya listened, his heart burning with fury.

After a long pause, Yang Kai finished speaking.

Meng Wuya nodded slightly. “So you are the principal culprit, but the mastermind is that Long Hui, correct?”

“Yes. This time, I’ve also implicated Junior Sister,” Yang Kai admitted.

“Though you are the principal culprit, it is not truly your fault. Ningshang was unharmed, so you need not worry,” Meng Wuya comforted him before sneering coldly, “Blood Battle Gang, Long Zaitian! I have taken note of this!”

Seeing the dangerous gleam in Meng Wuya’s eyes, Yang Kai knew that Long Zaitian was in serious trouble.

Yang Kai could not fathom or guess the origins and strength of Old Meng, but he sensed that this man was extraordinary. If he truly sought to settle scores with Long Zaitian, Yang Kai would be glad to see it—but it would not be entirely satisfying.

Yang Kai always believed that vengeance must be exacted by one’s own hand to feel complete. If Long Zaitian were to fall by Meng Wuya’s hand, Yang Kai would lose the chance to personally repay that grudge.

Still, he would not dissuade him. Meng Wuya was clearly enraged this time, his heart aflame with a fire that must be unleashed.

They remained at the inn for two more days until Xia Ningshang finally emerged from seclusion. As expected, her strength had reached the True Essence Realm. After some subtle questioning, Yang Kai learned that the Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew did not need to be fully refined to be effective.

In theory, a single drop of the Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew could be shared among three or four people, as it served merely as a catalyst to transform a martial artist’s Primordial Qi into True Essence.

However, this substance was peculiar—if not refined within an hour of absorption, it would vanish without a trace. Thus, it was generally used by only one person at a time.

Knowing this, Yang Kai relaxed. It seemed that his inadvertent absorption of half the Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew had not harmed Xia Ningshang.

Moreover, that half-drop of celestial spirit material had remained stored within his Golden Body and had not disappeared as she had claimed.

Yang Kai’s wounds had healed, and Xia Ningshang had advanced. The three of them naturally did not linger any longer and set out to return to Lingxiao Pavilion.

Yang Kai was carried back by Shopkeeper Meng, enduring a harsh wind that left him dizzy.

Back at Lingxiao Pavilion, Yang Kai bid farewell to his master and senior and returned to his small wooden hut.

Nearly twenty days away, yet the hut remained as neat as ever. It seemed that Li Yuntian and his group had been tending to it in his absence.

In the following days, Yang Kai resumed his peaceful routine, cultivating steadily to consolidate his current realm.

Yet in his idle moments, the image of that innocent Junior Sister would occasionally flash before his eyes. After all, she was the first woman he had kissed, and the sweet, soft sensation still lingered vividly in his memory.

But since returning, Xia Ningshang had not appeared.

It was as if she had forgotten their promise.

That night, in the mountain crevice, Yang Kai had said that if he returned alive, she would grant him one request.

At the time, Yang Kai had only sought a faint hope for himself, without deeper meaning.

Though somewhat disappointed, Yang Kai was not overly concerned.

I drifted quietly, waving my sleeve without taking a cloud—this fleeting kiss was merely to secure the Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew. Though both were moved in that moment, it meant nothing more. Youthful passion was inevitable in such circumstances.

Yang Kai did not feel inferior due to their difference in strength. Strength was something that could be improved through effort. He believed that one day he would surpass this Junior Sister, surpass all his peers.

Because of the Proud Bone Golden Body, limitless possibilities awaited him.

Love was not his current concern. What was meant to be his would be his; what was not, no amount of forcing would change. He would let fate take its course.

If Xia Ningshang cared for him, what did it matter if his strength was low? If she deliberately distanced herself because of his weakness, Yang Kai had nothing to say. If others looked down on him, who was he to blame their vision?

But with her innocent and pure nature, he doubted she would be so calculating.

Yang Kai’s intuition was correct. After returning to Lingxiao Pavilion, Xia Ningshang was truly too embarrassed to face him. Recalling that night’s passion, she felt shameful. Even with her veil, she could not bear to appear before him.

Moreover, upon her return, Meng Wuya had her enter seclusion again, ostensibly to consolidate her newly attained realm, but in truth to prevent her and Yang Kai from becoming entangled.

Otherwise, with her personality, she would have come to inquire about his recovery.

After two days of cultivation, Yang Kai was somewhat dissatisfied with his progress.

Absorbing Yang Qi by the Dragon Confinement Ravine to form Yang Liquid was too slow, far less efficient than directly consuming spirit fruits or absorbing Yang Flame Stones.

The Yang Liquid in his dantian was scant and needed replenishing quickly. Otherwise, if faced with a battle like that night again, he feared he would find himself in the embarrassing position of a clever housewife without rice to cook.

After some thought, Yang Kai decided to visit the Black Wind Trade Market once more—first to purchase items that could refine Yang Liquid, and second to buy the Three-Leaf Remnant Soul Flower and Desolate Deadwood Herb. It had been a long time since he had used the incense burner.

As for silver, Yang Kai now had plenty, no longer the pauper he once was.

All the silver had been looted from those Blood Battle Gang members. It was too dark at the time to count carefully, but upon tallying later, he found they were truly wealthy.

Just from a few men, he had obtained nearly twenty thousand taels of silver notes.

With so much silver, he could buy forty Yang Flame Stones—enough to make up for his losses that night and then some.

A few hours after Yang Kai set out for the Black Wind Trade Market, Meng Wuya also departed, his killing intent blazing.

His target was the Blood Battle Gang!

Though the Blood Battle Gang was one of the three great powers nearby, Meng Wuya feared them not. His disciple had nearly been killed, nearly lost her honor; this debt must be repaid.

Long Hui’s death was of no consequence! Did he not still have a grandfather? A crooked beam cannot support a straight pillar. If it were not for protection from above, how could a mere Long Hui be so arrogant and overbearing?

Thus, in Meng Wuya’s eyes, Long Zaitian was far more detestable and deserving of death.

Lingxiao Pavilion was not far from the Blood Battle Gang’s headquarters. Meng Wuya’s speed was swift, and in the time it took to drink a cup of tea, he arrived.

At this moment, the Blood Battle Gang’s senior members were engaged in a serious discussion.

In the main hall, the gang leader Hu Man sat upright. As his name suggested, he was broad-shouldered and muscular, with a face full of coarse flesh—a man clearly not to be trifled with.

Below Hu Man sat the gang’s chiefs and captains, all solemnly reporting the gang’s affairs over the past month, including income and expenditures.

Hu Man grew impatient and waved his hand. “Enough of these trivial matters. What of the breaking of the seals at the mining area?”

A youth of about twenty-seven or twenty-eight stood and respectfully reported, “Reporting to the gang leader, my grandfather has made some progress. However, the number of experts in the gang is too few. Though the seals are old, they are not easily broken. My grandfather recently sent a letter to Long Jun, instructing me to convey that he will do his utmost to break the seals as soon as possible.”

This youth was Long Jun, the eldest grandson of Long Zaitian and elder brother to Long Hui. Though only at the second stage of the True Essence Realm, his talent was respectable if not outstanding.

Because of the Long family’s status within the Blood Battle Gang, Long Jun held an important position as one of the gang’s chiefs.

Hu Man nodded slightly. “Good. Long Jun, if you have time, go to the mining area and convey my regards to your grandfather. Tell him his efforts are appreciated.”

“Yes.”

“I wonder what mysteries lie hidden within those seals, buried dozens of zhang underground,” one of the gang chiefs suddenly mused.

“That is thanks to our Miss Mei’er’s keen insight. If not for her saying there was something amiss beneath the mining area, we might never have known,” another chimed in.

“Yes, yes, though young, Miss Mei’er’s vision is extraordinary. I truly do not know how she discovered it,” others praised.

Hearing the flattery directed at Hu Mei’er, Hu Man felt pleased despite suspecting some sycophancy. Yet, thinking that Mei’er was a daughter who would eventually be married off, he sighed deeply.

Damn it, I am so wise and mighty, strong and powerful, with countless concubines, yet only two daughters were born? This was Hu Man’s sorrow—no sons to inherit his legacy.

The group continued to extol Hu Mei’er’s unique insight, and Hu Jiao’er was praised alongside her.

Hu Man remained sullen.

This matter was indeed strange. The mining area had been discovered years ago. The Blood Battle Gang had profited greatly from mining Yang Flame Stones and Yin Primordial Stones there. Much of the gang’s rapid growth in recent years was due to this mine.

Yet no one knew that dozens of zhang beneath the mining area lay many mysterious and profound seals.

Nearly two months ago, Hu Man’s youngest daughter, Hu Mei’er, suddenly returned and told him about this. He laughed it off, not taking it seriously.

Only when Mei’er persisted and insisted he send people to investigate did he reluctantly agree.

Though Mei’er had clearly warned him not to let the Long family know, Hu Man was indifferent, thinking it a daughter’s prank to attract his attention. Moreover, the mining area was under Long Zaitian’s control, so the matter could not be concealed.

Since the mine was already underground and near the location Mei’er indicated, after ten days of hard digging by a dozen Blood Battle Gang disciples, they found that place was indeed unusual.
