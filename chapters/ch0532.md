## Chapter 532 — Another Breakthrough?

News coming from Yang Wei’s residence to the outside world was one of passive resistance.

Although no information emerged from Yang Zhao’s residence, to any discerning observer, his situation was undoubtedly the worst.

Nan Sheng and figures like Xiang Chu had been killed right before Yang Zhao’s mansion. After that battle, the forces within the residence contracted drastically. Many factions withdrew from the succession war, leaving Yang Zhao’s estate. Within less than half an hour, the mansion’s front gate was deserted and coldly silent.

At this moment, the remaining forces in Yang Zhao’s estate barely amounted to a fraction of their former peak. In terms of martial cultivator numbers, Yang Zhao’s domain had plummeted from the greatest to the very bottom of the rankings.

Moreover, when considering the level of top-tier experts and overall strength, they simply could not compare to Yang Kai’s residence.

There were even rumors that since that day, Yang Zhao himself had lost his former vigor, appearing spiritless and lifeless as a walking corpse; a pitiful sight.

Those warriors still lingering in the mansion were dispirited, utterly lacking fighting spirit.

The succession war had, for all intents and purposes, already decided its victor.

Just as Yang Wei had anticipated, the fierce battle for the future Yang Family headship no longer needed to continue.

In War City, and across most of Zhongdu, everyone was convinced that Yang Kai would inevitably become the next head of the Yang Family, leading the Zhongdu Eight Great Families, holding immense power and control over the realm.

In the past few days, Yang Kai’s residence had been extraordinarily lively, guests coming and going like a river of fish, countless in number.

These visitors all sought to cultivate relations with Yang Kai in this final stretch.

Although none had truly contributed to the succession conflict—some were even former enemies of Yang Kai’s household—they now saw a golden opportunity.

They did not expect to make any real agreements or alliances with Yang Kai; at minimum, they hoped to become familiar faces.

So that when Yang Kai ascended as head of the Yang Family in the future, matters could be more easily negotiated.

All of these people arrived bearing many gifts, hoping to meet Yang Kai and at least exchange a few words.

Moreover, many came to propose matches; among these various clans, which did not have a few daughters of beauty and talent? Yang Kai was a man, and men naturally loved beautiful women — an eternal truth.

Should Yang Kai favor their daughters, it would mean they would become the future matriarch of the Yang Family! What honor could be more eye-catching?

The threshold of Yang Kai’s mansion was nearly worn down from so many coming and going.

Qiu Yimeng once again found herself overwhelmed as she hosted these visitors. Originally, she intended not to entertain these opportunists who turned as quickly as a page in a book, despising their fickle behavior.

But when Yang Kai learned of this, he actually ordered her to receive them warmly. Though confused, Qiu Yimeng had no choice but to comply.

She personally greeted every gift-bearing faction, exchanged a few words, took their gifts, and promptly sent them away.

As for those proposing marriages, Miss Qiu firmly blocked their entrances, refusing to receive them.

Within just a few days, Yang Kai’s estate welcomed over a hundred factions, assembling a vast wealth and an impressive quantity of resources at a stunning pace.

Qiu Yimeng was profoundly shocked.

Even as the eldest lady of the Qiu Family, she was astounded by the volume and quality of the materials amassed.

Five days later, the Yang Kai residence gradually returned to calm.

The busy crowd suddenly sensed a dominating aura spreading from the depths of the estate, containing energy fluctuations that stirred the heart and caused many to visibly change expression, focusing their attention on the origin.

Within moments, many gathered together.

“What’s going on?” Huo Xingchen shouted. He had just acquired a new Mystery-Grade Secret Treasure from the Baoqi Sect and hadn’t had time to refine it before this happened, leaving him quite astonished.

“It seems someone has just advanced,” Qiu Yimeng frowned slightly, “and not just one person.”

“I sense it too, two people advancing simultaneously…” Dong Fatty nodded lightly; the mixed aura rippling outward could not belong to merely one individual.

“But I feel like… one of them is Young Master Kai’s aura?” Huo Xingchen was confused. Yang Kai had only recently broken through to the Divine Roaming Realm a few days ago. Even with his exceptional talent and ability, it was impossible to breakthrough again so soon.

Could others still make any progress?

“Let’s go take a look,” Qiu Yimeng said, curiosity getting the better of her as she led the young group forward.

After a short walk, they arrived outside Xia Ningshang’s room. Before knocking, the door was pushed open.

Yang Kai stepped out, followed by the cool and aloof Su Yan. Both wore calm expressions, but anyone could see the joy and excitement hidden deep in their eyes.

“What’s going on? So many people coming.” Yang Kai frowned.

“Did someone here advance?” Qiu Yimeng peeked inside but saw nothing. Then, she scanned Yang Kai lightly with her faint Divine Sense, suddenly turning pale. “You actually…”

Among the young group, besides Qiu Yimeng, several had already broken into the Divine Roaming Realm. Sensing the change in Qiu Yimeng’s tone, they also checked Yang Kai and were immediately moved.

Yang Kai had already reached the Second Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm!

This explained the powerful aura released during the breakthrough.

Eyes widened across the board, everyone looked at Yang Kai in utter disbelief, their faces flushed with shock.

“Why all the fuss over breaking through a minor realm?” Yang Kai snorted.

“Minor realm?” Huo Xingchen screamed, “Young Master Kai, do you even know when your last breakthrough was?”

Who didn’t?

They had guarded nearby when Yang Kai broke through last time, even confronting eight experts above the Divine Roaming Realm.

That had all been just seven days ago.

Seven days—only seven days—and he broke through another tier. Such cultivation speed couldn’t be called anything but abnormal; he was a monster.

“Did she breakthrough with you?” Qiu Yimeng stared blankly at Su Yan.

Yang Kai nodded. Their dual cultivation this time had brought progress to both. Yang Kai advanced to the Divine Roaming Realm’s second tier; Su Yan reached the fourth tier, and their new power had been directly stabilized.

In terms of gains, Su Yan’s was even greater, since Yang Kai had only recently breached a major realm.

Suddenly, Huo Xingchen spoke awkwardly, “You two haven’t been spending these days in the room… doing other things, right?”

Before he could finish, Su Yan cast a piercing cold glance his way.

The eldest son, Young Master Huo, was immediately silenced. Though he was interested in women of such cool and noble demeanor, he instinctively feared Su Yan.

This woman… was extraordinary. Even Liu Qingyao of the Liu Family might not match her.

For some reason, Huo Xingchen was certain of his assumption.

Moreover, she belonged to Yang Kai. Huo Xingchen habitually avoided any woman close to Yang Kai, never daring to entertain improper thoughts.

“Got time to ask questions like that? Just go cultivate yourself,” Yang Kai scolded. Despite the abruptness of his breakthrough, it was the result of steady accumulation.

Everyone felt ashamed and quickly dispersed, determined to push through their own bottlenecks in seclusion.

Qiu Yimeng was also slightly flushed. Though she wished to cultivate, pressing responsibilities left her little time.

“Young Master, I have something to say.” Xiang Tianxiao did not leave but stayed behind, his expression serious as he looked at Yang Kai.

Since that fierce battle, Xiang Tianxiao had been seeking a chance to speak, but Yang Kai had been too busy until now.

Yang Kai glanced at him and nodded lightly.

“I’m going to find Junior Sister Xia,” Su Yan said with a word before leaving. She did not want to meddle in the affairs of Yang Kai’s residence.

Only Yang Kai, Qiu Yimeng, and Xiang Tianxiao remained.

The atmosphere suddenly grew heavy. Qiu Yimeng seemed to realize what Xiang Tianxiao was about to say and hurriedly spoke, “Second Young Master, I hope you carefully consider your words.”

Xiang Tianxiao calmly gave a slight nod.

“What is it? Say it.” Yang Kai looked at him.

Xiang Tianxiao took a deep breath and spoke briefly, “I’m leaving here. I’m quitting the succession war.”

Qiu Yimeng sighed deeply. Though she had warned Xiang Tianxiao, he still said it. She felt a pang of sorrow.

“Have you thought it through?” Yang Kai showed no surprise, as if he had known all along.

“Yes.”

“If you’ve decided… then go.” Yang Kai did not try to stop him.

Qiu Yimeng was shocked and stamped her foot, “Yang Kai!”

Yang Kai glanced at her coldly and said, “After all, I killed his eldest brother. If Second Young Master Xiang stayed to serve me, people would talk badly. Leaving here is the best choice.”

Xiang Tianxiao’s expression flickered, and gratitude briefly appeared.

Although Xiang Chu was his elder brother, their rivalry was no secret. Xiang Chu had spared no means to eliminate him. Yet, after all, they were brothers.

With Xiang Chu dead by Yang Kai’s hand, it was indeed inappropriate for Xiang Tianxiao to remain under the same roof. Even if the household understood him, those who had experienced what he did, how many in the world really understood?

Hearing Yang Kai’s words, Qiu Yimeng hesitated, unsure how to persuade him.

Others now battled ruthlessly just to get into Yang Kai’s residence, but here Xiang Tianxiao chose to leave at the cusp of ultimate victory in the succession war. At first glance, such a choice seemed irrational.

But Yang Kai knew Xiang Tianxiao’s convictions; he was not someone driven merely by profit.

If he were, he would never have joined Yang Kai when he was at his lowest. Though the numbers and power Xiang brought were limited, they had given their all in every fight.

“Thank you for these past months,” Yang Kai nodded slightly at Xiang Tianxiao.

Xiang Tianxiao, normally meticulous, smiled, “Likewise. Thank you for your care, Young Master!”

The pills from the Alchemy Room and treasures from the Baoqi Sect were divided among Xiang’s warriors. Thanks to this fortune, their abilities had improved several levels.

The smile faded, his cold face returned. Xiang Tianxiao’s voice dropped low, “Young Master, when we meet again, it will be as enemies. I won’t hold back… farewell.”

“I’ll see you off!”
