## Chapter 516 — Just You Seven?

With these seven Divine Roaming Realm experts covering the rear, no matter how formidable Yang Kai was, he could not possibly catch up.

Moreover, War City was already within sight, only a hundred li away. Although Xiang Chu was helpless, he could only come up with this plan to buy time and slow Yang Kai’s pace.

The seven heard Xiang Chu’s words. Their expressions momentarily changed, but they quickly steeled themselves and nodded firmly: "Rest assured, Young Master, even if it costs us our lives, we will hold him back."

Xiang Chu nodded heavily, "Good, everyone be careful. Do not let your guard down!"

"Understood!"

With that, the seven Divine Roaming Realm experts from the Xiang and Nan clans suddenly halted their steps, turned around as one, and stopped to look back.

Xiang Chu and Nan Sheng led the remaining group, not once looking back, continuing to flee.

Seeing the seven halt, Yang Kai's expression darkened as he swept his Divine Sense ahead, instantly grasping their cultivation and strength. A trace of impatience surfaced on his face.

“Ninth Young Master, if you want to chase after our Young Master, you’ll have to get past us first!” one of them barked. The seven simultaneously activated their True Yuan, the radiance of their Mystery-Grade Secret Treasures and Martial Skills blooming fiercely as they charged at Yang Kai.

They had no intention of exchanging words with Yang Kai. Things had come to this point; only combat would prove the truth.

“Just you seven?” Yang Kai laughed arrogantly. A Lower-Level Mystery-Grade Bone Shield suddenly appeared in his hand, raised before him to block the storm of attacks and charged forward.

Boom, boom, boom…

A series of loud clashes erupted. Wild energy surged recklessly. Every collision forced Yang Kai to slightly stagger, yet the maw-shaped opening in the center of his Bone Shield swallowed each energy strike whole. As the energy was consumed, the shield’s area visibly expanded.

After the assault, Yang Kai remained unscathed, though his speed was significantly slowed.

“Disperse!” Knowing the secret of the Bone Shield, none of them dared to cluster. A shout was issued and they scattered in all directions.

A faint glow burst from the Bone Shield’s maw. It tilted diagonally along the shield’s edge. Sharp bone spikes lining the shield rang sharply.

With a clang, the absorbed energy suddenly returned.

Whizz! Whizz! Whizz!

The bone spikes along the shield’s edge all shot out, trailing brilliant light as they attacked the seven.

The seven were prepared, quickly deploying their own Mystery-Grade Secret Treasures to defend and dodging hastily.

After some skirmishes, the seven avoided the Bone Shield’s retaliatory attacks. The bone spikes were blocked by various countermeasures. Though battered and disorganized, none were injured.

Indeed, the Bone Shield was formidable. No Divine Roaming cultivator below the Eighth Stage could break through its defenses. But if one specifically targeted its unique traits, it would become difficult for the shield to exert full effect. After all, a Secret Treasure was inanimate, while a person was alive.

Besides, these seven had no intention of fighting Yang Kai to the death. Their goal was solely to delay him, just long enough—a single cup of tea’s time—so that Nan Sheng and Xiang Chu could safely return to War City and reach Yang Zhao’s residence.

As their plan succeeded, the seven's expressions grew inspired. They suddenly realized Yang Kai was not as terrifying as imagined.

Perhaps he was unbeatable among peers, even able to go toe-to-toe with Divine Roaming masters, but he relied on external aid to massacre over a hundred people in one go.

Without such aid, his strength had limits.

Perhaps this time they could not only hold him off but also seize the opportunity to capture him while he was unguarded! Thoughts like these surged their spirits. Their previously wavering confidence instantly rose into fierce determination.

Without hesitation, they unleashed their Divine Soul techniques, layers of Divine Sense energy weaving around Yang Kai like a spider web, enclosing him tightly.

Standing at the heart of this Divine Sense convergence, Yang Kai slowly shook his head with disdain.

Since refining the Soul Evil Spirit’s origin in the Bloodthirsty Evil Cave, Divine Sense attacks scared him no more. The seven’s Divine Sense power was like trickling stream before his vast ocean—utterly unable to shake his mind.

On the contrary, Yang Kai suddenly exploded with Divine Sense power, causing their minds to chill as if frozen.

They were shocked and terrified, unsure of what kind of Divine Soul Treasure Yang Kai wielded to reach such an extent.

“Xiang Chu left you all here just as cannon fodder. Why bother trying so hard?” Yang Kai shook his head, unwilling to further entangle with them. “Even if he escapes War City, his life is still mine. You’ll only die with no value.”

The seven’s expressions turned grim. One said, “Ninth Young Master, no need for division tactics. We are born of the Xiang and Nan clans, and we will die as their ghosts. It is our duty to protect the Young Master’s safety. If you are so confident, Ninth Young Master, then show us your supreme skills.”

“Very well, I’ll grant your wish!” Yang Kai nodded gently, his expression suddenly calm as the Bone Shield vanished, and he slowly raised his right hand.

As his hand lifted, the seven suddenly felt an ominous presence, as if all in the world had frozen. Their eyes involuntarily widened, filled with shock and terror as they stared at Yang Kai. They wanted to attack but found themselves unable to move.

In this realm, only Yang Kai could move.

His right middle finger touched his forehead. A dreamy whisper echoed suddenly:

“Enter Demonic State!”

The sky trembled. The earth hummed. An illusion of heaven and earth collapsing stirred in every heart.

A darkness capable of devouring light and hope burst from Yang Kai. This dense black energy was bloodthirsty, violent, and malevolent. Its aura filled the air, forcing a hint of terror into the hearts of the seven.

As Yang Kai’s aura grew, each of the seven felt a deep sense of powerlessness arise within.

The power Yang Kai displayed utterly shocked them.

The evil energy within the Proud Bone Golden Body had not been used for some time. Yang Kai had held back out of consideration for the hostility between the Eight Great Families and the Cangyun Evil Land, concealing his malevolent side.

Now, desperate to kill Xiang Chu and Nan Sheng, he no longer hesitated or held back.

The jet-black evil energy only appeared briefly before being wholly absorbed by Yang Kai’s body.

Looking again, Yang Kai was still the same Yang Kai, but to the seven, he felt entirely different.

Moments ago they still imagined they'd jointly capture Yang Kai and bring honor to Nan Sheng and Xiang Chu. Now, no one dared entertain that thought.

For some reason, facing the present Yang Kai, the seven felt utterly cornered.

Their eyes darkened as if clouded by black fog, swallowed by darkness without a trace of light or direction.

Cold and merciless gazes arrived. The seven involuntarily took a few startled steps backward.

Yang Kai raised his hand slightly. Several slender, black energies shot forth like snakes escaping a hole with sharp hisses, aiming at one man.

That man’s face changed dramatically as he hurried to dodge, but no sooner had he moved than his body trembled. Black energy instantly covered his exposed skin as he fell backward.

One strike, one Divine Roaming Realm Third Stage cultivator dead, utterly defenseless.

The remaining six paled and stood silent as death.

They hadn’t even seen how this man was hit and hadn’t expected Yang Kai to be so powerful in this moment.

That day, under Taifang Mountain, Yang Kai wielded True Yuan at Fifth Stage to slay two Divine Roaming Realm Second Stagers; now, just one step from entering the Divine Roaming Realm himself, his strength naturally far surpassed then.

These Third and Fourth Stage Divine Roaming figures were nothing in his eyes.

“Those who block my path… die!” Yang Kai’s low voice rumbled as the sky suddenly darkened. A black palm print, like rolling storm clouds, descended upon the six from above. Growing ever larger, it loomed like a hand that could cover the heavens, making them feel there was no escape.

The six screamed in horror, frantically exerting True Yuan to escape, but no matter how hard they tried, they could not avoid the strike.

The ground shook with an impact.

The black palm imprint struck the earth, gouging a deep dent with countless snapping bones audible. The six, some sprawled, some crawling, all fell inside the hollow.

Though none died, the evil energy corroded their minds and bodies, clouding their consciousness.

Bones shattered everywhere. They’d likely never recover in their lifetime.

“You were told you’re just cannon fodder, yet still stubborn!” Yang Kai shook his head.

Nan Sheng and Xiang Chu knew he had massively increased his strength, but it seemed none had told these seven.

If the seven knew this, they would never have dared hope to capture Yang Kai; they wouldn’t have been beaten so badly.

Ignoring the six’s fate, Yang Kai glanced at War City a hundred li away. He snorted coldly and surged forward in pursuit.

Even if Xiang Chu and Nan Sheng truly hid within Yang Zhao’s residence, death was inevitable today!

War City.

Nan Sheng and Xiang Chu looked frantic as they and a group of cultivators pressed urgently inside. Passersby catching sight of their disheveled appearance were full of suspicion and confusion—wondering who could have pursued them to such a desperate state.

Everyone was sweating and exhausted, their True Yuan nearly depleted. They shouted for people to clear the way while rushing to Yang Zhao’s mansion.

The news quickly spread to Yang Wei’s and Yang Kai’s estates.

Yang Wei frowned deeply, unclear exactly what had transpired, but sensing a major event unfolding, quietly left his residence with his Blood Servants heading toward Yang Zhao’s estate.

At Yang Kai’s residence, Qiu Yimeng’s face turned pale upon hearing the news. She immediately ordered the various powerful factions within the estate to move out towards War City, preparing to welcome Yang Kai’s return.

She was unsure what exactly Nan Sheng and Xiang Chu had encountered but sensed it was related to Yang Kai.
