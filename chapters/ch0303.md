## Chapter 303 — Poison Widow

Yang Kai's reaction speed was astonishingly quick; he had almost moved the moment Shan Qingluo unleashed her alluring arts.

Shan Qingluo was secretly astonished, unable to comprehend how he could escape the illusion so swiftly. Not to mention that he was merely at the Fourth Stage of the True Essence Realm, even someone in the Divine Roaming Realm would not be able to do so so easily in front of her.

Which sect did this little rogue come from?

The black aura on the Shura Sword surged like a spirit snake emerging from its hole, stabbing toward Guo Yuanming's neck.

Guo Yuanming's vacant eyes suddenly burst forth with a glimmer of cold light, a sinister smile curling at the corners of his mouth. Yang Kai's expression darkened, hastily shifting from offense to defense, his True Essence erupting with great force.

"Ding..." Yang Kai rolled backward, returning to Shan Qingluo's side, his hand gripping the sword slightly trembling, blood surging in reverse, letting out a heavy grunt before finally calming down.

"Hahaha!" Guo Yuanming laughed loudly, his expression filled with pride mixed with lewdness, licking his lips as he lewdly stared at Shan Qingluo, saying, "I have long heard of the Queen's dream realm; it truly is extraordinary!"

Shan Qingluo's charming face flashed with a hint of coldness, realizing that Guo Yuanming and the others had been prepared for this.

"If the Queen's strength were intact, we naturally would not be able to resist this dream realm, but now... heh heh!" Guo Yuanming lewdly laughed, raising his arm and shouting, "Brothers, it seems the Queen is not in good health; be gentle when you strike later, lest you damage our Queen's delicate body!"

"Rest assured, Brother Guo, we will handle it gently!" Yuan Shi stepped forward boldly, his gaze fixed on Shan Qingluo, showing no fear.

"Hehehe..." A series of lewd laughs erupted. The group, initially a bit anxious, now felt emboldened as they prepared to resist Shan Qingluo's dream realm.

Shan Qingluo's anger turned to mockery as she looked at the crowd, her demeanor exuding charm, her voice soft and sweet, "Do you truly believe you can capture me?"

Seeing her calm and composed, without a hint of fear, Guo Yuanming's heart skipped a beat, and his expression faltered.

After a moment, he gritted his teeth and spoke in a low voice, "Everyone, you must understand that once the bow is drawn, there is no turning back. We have already offended this wretched maid! If we let her escape this time, I believe I need not remind you what fate awaits us!"

With Shan Qingluo's methods and temperament, if she were to escape, these few would not find peace even if they hid to the ends of the earth.

Understanding the severity of the situation, the others nodded solemnly.

"Then it seems we can only fight with all our might. To taste the most enchanting woman in the world, what fear is there in death?" Guo Yuanming said in a deep voice, "Ban, you are the weakest; deal with that annoying little brat. Resolve him quickly and come assist us!"

A thin man glanced at Yang Kai, grinning wickedly, "No problem!"

Shan Qingluo giggled, her True Essence quietly gathering as she suddenly waved her hands forward, shouting, "Dare to offend me, you will all die!"

Countless crystalline white threads suddenly filled the sky, enveloping the crowd below.

These six or seven individuals were all in the Divine Roaming Realm, but their strength was not particularly high; most were at the First or Second Stage, with only Guo Yuanming at the Third Stage.

As Shan Qingluo launched her attack, the others hurriedly activated their techniques, wielding treasures to defend themselves.

Yang Kai waved his hand, and nearly a thousand sword energies appeared beside him, shooting forth like a torrential downpour, while the Thousand-Petal Blood Sea Begonia also activated instantly.

Crimson petals danced in the air, transforming the world into a sea of flowers!

The opponents were all in the Divine Roaming Realm, and Yang Kai had no intention of holding back.

Such a dense attack left the enemies in a flurry, struggling to defend themselves.

Shan Qingluo swiftly formed seals with her hands. The crystalline threads that filled the sky suddenly seemed to come alive, wrapping around two First Stage Divine Roaming Realm experts.

These two were already the weakest, and in a moment of carelessness, they were ensnared by the threads.

Seizing the opportunity, Yang Kai unleashed the Divine Ox Seal, two pitch-black beast souls roaring to the sky, baring their fangs as they charged at the two, viciously biting down.

The crimson petals combined with the attack, each one sharp as a blade, and soon, a series of heart-wrenching screams echoed from that direction, causing Guo Yuanming and the others to turn pale with fright.

Puff puff puff...

Blood splattered!

Shan Qingluo's eyes flashed with astonishment; she had not expected Yang Kai to unleash such might. That series of fierce and overwhelming attacks was not something a Fourth Stage True Essence Realm martial artist could unleash.

With a gentle grip, the threads tightened, instantly dismembering the two already battered First Stage Divine Roaming Realm experts.

In a single encounter, they had killed two Divine Roaming Realm practitioners.

At the same time, more white threads suddenly erupted from Shan Qingluo's delicate body, enveloping the remaining individuals.

With graceful steps, she swiftly approached Yang Kai, linking her arm with his, and commanded, "Run!"

Yang Kai beckoned, the thousand petals rapidly returning to his body without pause, as he activated his movement technique, quickly fleeing with Shan Qingluo.

This enchantress was currently only at the Third Stage of the True Essence Realm, and to be able to join forces with him to slay two Divine Roaming Realm experts was already her maximum output. Although the battle was short, her consumption of True Essence must have been considerable; staying any longer would yield no good.

"Wretched maid!" Guo Yuanming's furious shout came from behind; he seemed to have not anticipated that Shan Qingluo was merely feigning an attack. Only after her departure did he realize she had no intention of engaging.

After a good while, Guo Yuanming and the others finally broke free from the entanglement of the white threads, their faces flushed and filled with lingering fear as they stared in the direction Shan Qingluo had vanished, thinking to themselves that the Evil King was indeed formidable; even when severely injured, she was not so easily dealt with.

"What do we do now?" Yuan Shi asked with a grim face.

Guo Yuanming gritted his teeth, "If you don't want to be hunted down by her, we must pursue and kill her!"

"Listen to Brother Guo!" The remaining few nodded in unison.

Without further hesitation, they hurriedly gave chase.

Shan Qingluo, linking arms with Yang Kai, initially intended to take him away, but as they began to run, she realized that this little rogue's speed was not much slower than her own. With a few quick steps, he seemed to have employed some strange movement technique, swiftly covering dozens of zhang.

As they ran, her ample bosom brushed against Yang Kai's elbow, causing Shan Qingluo's face to flush slightly, and she quickly tried to withdraw her arm.

"Don't!" Yang Kai quickly stopped her, "My movement technique is for short-distance shifts; once my Primordial Qi is exhausted, I need to rest for a moment, and at that time, I will need your help!" Yang Kai pressed her hand down.

"Oh!" Shan Qingluo nodded slightly, continuing to link arms with Yang Kai as they sped away together.

Half an hour later, Guo Yuanming and the others were closing in!

They also understood the dire consequences of allowing Shan Qingluo to escape, so they were desperately pursuing her.

Shan Qingluo bit her lip, gritting her teeth, "If I can escape this time, I will make sure they have a terrible end!"

Yang Kai shrugged, "You might want to think about what would happen if they caught you."

Shan Qingluo's complexion suddenly paled, her heart filled with fear, and her delicate body couldn't help but tremble.

Suddenly, a charming blush appeared on her face as she resolutely stated, "If that truly happens... before that, I will hand myself over to you! After all, you don't look bad, and it's better than falling into the hands of those losers."

"Ah..." Yang Kai turned his head in surprise, speechless, "Beauty, while I'm glad to hear you say that, I know that after being taken by you, there will be no good outcome, so let's skip it; I can't afford it."

Shan Qingluo shot him a resentful glance, softly saying, "So you know."

"I certainly do."

In this life-and-death situation, there was no need for concealment. Shan Qingluo sighed and explained, "My physique is special; it's called Poison Widow!"

Yang Kai was taken aback, quickly asking, "What kind of physique is that? What are its characteristics?"

"If I become emotional, all my bodily fluids will contain deadly poison, including the breath I exhale!" Shan Qingluo smiled sweetly at him, "Now you should understand why you fainted the last time I kissed you, right?"

Recalling that sweet and wonderful taste, Yang Kai couldn't help but lick his lips.

"The deeper the emotion, the more potent the poison! Last time was just a small warning; who told you to be so unruly!"

Yang Kai awkwardly chuckled, "I was also forced; you captured me without reason first, um... all bodily fluids, does that include... down there?"

Shan Qingluo's face turned red, and she spat, "Rogue!"

Yang Kai was horrified, "Then wouldn't doing it just mean certain death?"

"Yes!" Shan Qingluo took a deep breath, regretting discussing this with him now. This little rogue had no filter, saying whatever came to his mind, making it quite unbearable.

Yang Kai pondered, "How about... I get you all hot and bothered, and you spit some poison to kill them?"

"Can you be serious?" Shan Qingluo could no longer endure it; even at this moment, what was this rascal thinking?

"I’m being serious," Yang Kai said with a straight face.

While they were talking, their feet did not slow down, moving like the wind. Suddenly, they broke free from the forest.

Their pace abruptly halted as they stared in shock at the scene ahead.

Not far away, there were actually two groups of people.

One group had completely surrounded another group, and those being encircled looked pale and resentful.

Yang Kai raised his eyes and couldn't help but exclaim softly.

He discovered that the encircled group was actually led by Qiu Yimeng, including the voluptuous Luo Xiaoman and Bai Yunfeng from the Bai Family, along with three or four other True Essence Realm martial artists. There were also a few corpses on the ground, blood flowing freely.

The outer circle of people was looking at Qiu Yimeng and the others with sinister smiles, most of their gazes lingering on Qiu Yimeng and Luo Xiaoman's beautiful figures, revealing lewdness.

Qiu Yimeng smiled bitterly, while Luo Xiaoman's face lost color. The two women stood back to back, gasping for breath, their True Essence nearly depleted.

After fleeing for so many days, they had finally been caught today by the martial artists from the Cangyun Evil Land. After a fierce battle, their subordinates had suffered heavy casualties, and they were completely surrounded.

Seeing that escape was hopeless, at that moment, Yang Kai and Shan Qingluo rushed in.
