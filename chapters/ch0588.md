## Chapter 588 — Complete Purification

In the place where Divine Sense energy converged, the spirit bodies of forty or fifty ancestors from the Yang Family all stared at Yang Kai in astonishment, enveloped in silence.

After quite a while, a burst of laughter echoed out: “What an arrogant claim!”

Yang Yi also wore a faint, strange smile. “So your intention is to completely consume us all?”

Yang Kai nodded solemnly.

“Hahahahaha!” Countless laughs rang out, as if Yang Kai had just told a particularly amusing joke, causing them to lose control.

Yang Yi nodded gently. “If you truly have this ability, we would gladly let you devour us all. After all, it was our greatest wish for our spirit bodies to enter this place. However, based on your current strength, this is simply impossible.”

“Then esteemed predecessors, please wait and see!” Yang Kai grinned widely and released the suppressed tremors within his spirit body.

Since arriving here, his spirit body had involuntarily generated a strong pull—an attraction emanating from the Golden Pupil Eye within his Sea of Consciousness.

But before comprehending the mysteries here, Yang Kai had suppressed this pull.

Now, having freed this binding force, an immense suction swept through the entire space. The spirit bodies of the forty or fifty Yang Family ancestors were all moved; before they could even react, they were drawn into Yang Kai’s Sea of Consciousness.

The sky was cloudless for thousands of miles, and the sea beneath was crystal clear. A vividly colored treasure island stood silently on the surface of the water.

The sudden shift in surroundings left those forty or fifty spirit bodies bewildered. All stared blankly around, none able to react.

“Welcome, everyone!” Yang Kai’s spirit body gradually revealed itself, hands folded behind his back, extending a warm greeting as if returning home.

“This is your Sea of Consciousness?” Yang Yi exclaimed in surprise.

“Yes, this is precisely my Sea of Consciousness.”

“How did you achieve this?” Yang Yi looked at Yang Kai with disbelief, clearly unable to fathom how he had managed to absorb all the spirit bodies into his Sea of Consciousness.

“It’s not my doing—it’s because of this,” Yang Kai said, gesturing at the Golden Pupil Eye hovering above the Five-Colored Treasure Island.

Following his indication, Yang Yi and the others turned to look. For some unknown reason, an inexplicable sense of unease and dread filled everyone’s hearts as if that unknown object was their nemesis.

“What is that?” Yang Yi’s expression grew anxious. Over these endless years, she had long forgotten what fear felt like, but now she once again clearly sensed the meaning of terror.

Not only she but also the other forty or fifty spirit bodies trembled uncontrollably, their postures trembling with dread, their expressions fierce and grim, staring deeply at the Golden Pupil Eye like ferocious beasts lying in ambush, exuding extreme danger.

“I do not know what it is, but it can sever the painful shackles that have bound you for countless years,” Yang Kai softly inhaled, looking at Yang Yi and the others. “I do not know what state of mind led you to conceal your spirit bodies within the Four Sacred Beast statues before death, but since the endless years have twisted your wills, then today, we shall bring this to an end.”

As he spoke, the tightly shut Golden Pupil Eye slowly opened.

Yang Kai made no empty threats and directly prepared to act.

The majestic golden pupil instilled in all an involuntary reverence and trepidation.

Whoosh—

A shaft of golden light shot forth from the single eye, illuminating a spirit body that stood stunned without time to react.

With a crackling sound, the consciousness and thoughts hidden within that spirit body were instantly purified, leaving behind only a great sphere of pure energy.

Whoosh whoosh whoosh—

One after another, golden beams were fired, purifying wave after wave of spirit bodies. Facing the supreme dignity of the golden light, these spirit bodies barely had strength to resist.

Terror instantly filled Yang Yi’s eyes. She finally understood why Yang Kai was so confident to claim he could swallow them all.

This strange golden light could purify their consciousness and thoughts completely; the remaining pure energy could be absorbed by anyone.

“I will not be destroyed!” Suddenly, a roar burst forth. An ancestor from one generation of the Yang Family could no longer suppress his desire and instinct upon seeing so many spirit bodies eliminated. Like a raging ghost, he howled furiously and charged at Yang Kai, claws extended, intent on restraining him to seize a chance for survival.

Yang Kai looked at him coldly, his gaze tinged with complexity—both pity and regret.

He pitied their spirit bodies, which had suffered countless years of torment while imprisoned for so long. He lamented that although their wishes and original intentions were noble, their true nature had been gradually altered over time.

“Stop!” Yang Yi suddenly shouted fiercely.

Hearing her command, the spirit body that intended to attack Yang Kai halted abruptly, eyes swirling with countless emotions. Though so close, it could not strike.

“Do you wish to destroy the pride that the ancestors of the Yang Family have maintained for so many years?” Yang Yi said calmly.

Her words struck like thunderclaps, briefly clearing the tormented eyes.

With a long howl, he abandoned Yang Kai and turned to rush toward the wide-open Golden Pupil Eye.

Golden light shot down and purified him.

In the next moment, the remaining spirit bodies all surged upwards together, expressing complex emotions—both joy and fear.

Whoosh whoosh whoosh—

Yang Kai watched coldly without interference, allowing them to rush toward the Golden Pupil Eye like moths drawn to a flame.

Soon, only Yang Yi remained in the entire Sea of Consciousness; all the other spirit bodies had been entirely purified.

Yang Yi took a gentle breath and looked at Yang Kai with gratitude. With a deep voice, she said, “I will speak on their behalf to thank you!”

Yang Kai’s eyes flickered slightly. “You’re welcome.”

“With you as the head of this generation of the Yang Family, great accomplishments are certain,” Yang Yi smiled, her withered face slowly changing until she transformed into a breathtakingly beautiful young woman.

Her long hair floated gracefully, her delicate brows arched softly, her starry eyes gleamed seductively, her elegant nose and rosy cheeks formed a beautiful visage like a painted blossom. Her porcelain-like skin was as tender as snow, an exquisite figure that stunned all who saw her.

Yang Kai momentarily lost himself.

“This was my appearance in youth. At my final moment, I wish to depart in this form,” Yang Yi said with a slight smile, then her tone turned sharp and strict: “Young one, if you dare reveal what happened here, even as a ghost, I shall never spare you.”

“I wouldn’t dare...” Yang Kai responded, oddly.

Yang Yi nodded softly, her form flickered, turning into a beam of light ascending upward.

The Golden Pupil Eye shot out another beam of golden light that struck her.

A sharp crackling noise rang out as Yang Yi’s consciousness and thoughts swiftly dissolved.

In her final instant, Yang Kai seemed to see a peaceful expression surface on her face.

The Golden Pupil Eye slowly closed, and as the sea breeze blew, four or five dozen pure energy spheres floated above the Sea of Consciousness.

Yang Kai waved his hand, gathering these energies into one place.

The ancestors of the Yang Family had painstakingly hidden their spirit bodies within the Four Sacred Beast statues before death, hoping to offer aid to their descendants. Yet no matter how noble the wish or deliberate the plan, none could resist the ravages of time.

Yang Yi had said many spirit bodies had already broken down under the relentless passage of time, losing all consciousness, leaving only savage energy that was destroyed by them.

Such a fate likely awaited every one of them.

The Yang Family’s action was a help to the living but a desecration to the dead. Yang Kai neither judged nor wished to judge this right or wrong.

After a long pause, Yang Kai approached one of the pure energy spheres and sat cross-legged, beginning to absorb it.

Gradually, he discovered a problem.

The power gained from these energies was far too little, almost negligible.

The cruel and endless passage of time had continuously depleted the Divine Sense energy of the Yang Family ancestors. How much energy remained now within their spirit bodies?

Perhaps less than one-thousandth of their prime strength.

Such energy naturally could not significantly enhance Yang Kai’s power.

However, the insights into the Heavenly Dao and Martial Dao embedded in these subtle forces, the enlightenment left behind by the Yang Family ancestors, remained intact.

These insights alone brought immense benefit to Yang Kai.

As Yang Yi had said, after absorbing these, anyone would face no bottleneck before reaching the Transcendent Realm.

As Yang Kai’s Divine Roaming Realm advanced, each ascent became increasingly difficult—not due to his strength, but because his understanding of the Divine Roaming Realm was insufficient.

Now, having absorbed the enlightenment of the Yang ancestors, this issue no longer troubled him.

Moreover, having previously absorbed the Divine Sense energy and insights of several Transcendent Realm figures, Yang Kai estimated that for a long time he would encounter no bottlenecks.

Perhaps all the way to the Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm!

Ecstatic, Yang Kai felt the joy wash away the faint grief within his heart and absorbed the energy with zeal.

Two days later, Yang Kai slowly opened his eyes. Although his cultivation level had hardly changed, remaining at Divine Roaming Realm Fifth Stage, his comprehension of the Divine Roaming Realm had reached an unparalleled depth, thanks to the treasures left by the Yang ancestors.

Not only was his understanding of the Divine Roaming Realm unmatched, but now he also possessed a strong recognition of the Transcendent Realm.

Yang Kai still stood in the center of the Divine Root Hall, a life aura behind him belonging to Yang Yinghao.

However, at this moment, Yang Kai sensed that his elder uncle’s aura was strange, as if his heart was deeply unsettled.

Moving slightly, Yang Kai turned and called out, “Elder Uncle.”

“Succeeded?” Yang Yinghao asked anxiously.

Entering the Divine Root Hall was also a test the Yang Family placed on their Family Heads. If they could gain no benefit from within, then the head was unsuitable to continue. Seeing that Yang Kai had finally regained composure, Yang Yinghao hastened to inquire.
