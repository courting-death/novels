## Chapter 104 — Yuan Lang’s Speculation

The three could not accept this truth no matter how hard they tried.

Lying on the ground was a Separation and Union Realm expert—an expert of the Separation and Union Realm! How could he have been slain by a mere Open Origin Realm cultivator?

The gap between the two was two great Realms; this was an utterly laughable matter.

Although Senior Brother Cai had been sealed to a large extent by that woman, and had to expend Primordial Qi and spirit to resist the valley’s invading Yin energy, he should at least have been able to exert the strength of the Qi Movement Realm, right? How could he have been killed?

Their faces shifted between pale and flushed, a mixture of shock and lingering fear.

Each of them thought silently: if Yang Kai’s target had been oneself instead of Senior Brother Cai, what would the outcome have been? Without a doubt, they too would have died here.

Only now did Yuan Lang understand Senior Brother Cai’s wisdom and vigilance. Had it not been for his warning, he himself might have been the first to perish at Yang Kai’s hands.

“Senior Brother, how exactly did he die?” The weakest among them finally spoke, breaking the awkward and heavy silence.

Upon hearing this, the three exchanged glances. The scene of the battle replayed in their minds, finally revealing the trace of Yang Kai’s attack.

It was that exchange of injury for injury—a single palm strike! The only offensive move Yang Kai had used in the entire fight.

“Is his strength really that formidable?” one asked in horror.

“That is not his true ability! He must have concealed some secret treasure of immense lethality, otherwise he could never have broken through Senior Brother’s Primordial Qi defenses and killed him in one blow!” Yuan Lang cast a glance at him, his mind gradually cooling as he analyzed the situation.

Another nodded in agreement.

Without the power of a secret treasure, how could Yang Kai alone achieve such a feat? Even if Yang Kai admitted it himself, they would not believe it.

“The Primordial Qi required to activate that treasure must be enormous, yet his strength is only at the Open Origin Realm. Therefore, he could only strike once. After that single blow, regardless of success or failure, he would immediately flee!” Yuan Lang’s face darkened. The more he thought, the clearer his reasoning became. His mind sharpened, as if holding a precious insight. His speculation fit well with Yang Kai’s suspicious actions.

Yuan Lang said with certainty, “So, even if he still has some strength left, it is but the last breath of a spent arrow. That treasure can no longer be activated, and with such grievous injuries, he is no longer a threat!”

The other two found his analysis reasonable, and their tense hearts finally relaxed.

It turned out that only by relying on a secret treasure could such a feat be accomplished. That was terrifying enough! If his strength were truly so monstrous that even Senior Brother Cai could be easily slain, then they might as well prepare their necks for the noose instead of clinging to life.

The weakest Blood Battle Gang disciple said, “Senior Brother has been killed. Should we return to report this?”

Yuan Lang turned to him with a light scolding, “Return for what?”

“If we don’t report it, wouldn’t that be improper?” the disciple hesitated.

Another looked thoughtfully at the youth and suddenly laughed, addressing the weakest one, “Brother Wu, you don’t understand Senior Brother Yuan’s intention.”

Brother Wu looked confused, glancing between the two and Yuan Lang, unable to grasp their meaning.

Yuan Lang chuckled, “It is Brother Ye who is sharp-minded; nothing escapes your notice.”

Brother Ye laughed heartily in return, “Great minds think alike.”

Brother Wu, watching their cryptic exchange, could not understand the key point and spoke helplessly, “Brothers, could you please explain things more plainly?”

Yuan Lang glanced at him before speaking, “Brother Wu, what grade do you think the secret treasure Yang Kai relied on is?”

Brother Wu thought for a moment, then answered slowly, “Among the four of us surrounding him, he was able to kill Senior Brother Cai in one strike. The treasure’s grade must be high—at least Earth-Grade Middle-Level! Quite possibly Earth-Grade Upper-Level.”

They had all personally witnessed Xia Ningshang wield a Heaven-Grade defensive secret treasure. Now, Yang Kai possessing an Earth-Grade treasure was hardly surprising. Brother Wu’s estimate was the lowest possible, making the speculation reasonable.

Yuan Lang nodded slightly. “If we report this to Chief Wen, what do you think the outcome will be?”

Brother Wu instinctively said, “Yang Kai will be killed, and the secret treasure will be taken by Chief Wen…”

He stopped mid-sentence, suddenly realizing everything.

If Chief Wen learned that Yang Kai possessed an Earth-Grade secret treasure, would there be any benefit left for them? The Heaven-Grade treasure on that woman had already been claimed by Young Master Long Hui. Chief Wen could not have the meat without the broth, could he? As for them, they might not even get to lick the broth’s bottom.

At best, upon returning, Chief Wen might reward them with some gold and silver. After such a perilous ordeal, with several brothers lost, was that all they would gain?

Serving others required some return. They had just walked through the valley of death, their hearts still pounding wildly—how could a few coins make up for that?

Moreover, Chief Wen was known to be stingy; even if he rewarded them, it would be meager.

“So, Brothers mean to say…” Brother Wu probed cautiously.

Yuan Lang and Brother Ye exchanged a glance. Brother Ye nodded slightly, “Whatever Senior Brother Yuan says, we shall follow.”

Yuan Lang chuckled, “Very well. Since the two of you have no objections, we shall not report this matter!”

“Agreed!” the two nodded.

“As for the secret treasure in Yang Kai’s possession…” Yuan Lang smiled faintly, turning to the two disciples, “Whoever kills him and avenges Senior Brother Cai shall claim that treasure. How does that sound?”

Brother Ye nodded, “As Senior Brother Yuan says!”

“Shall we split up?” Brother Wu was the weakest and, having just witnessed Senior Brother Cai’s death, naturally felt alarmed, fearing he could not handle Yang Kai one-on-one.

Brother Ye said, “What is there to fear? Yang Kai has only activated his secret treasure once; how much Primordial Qi could he have left? Besides, he fought a fierce battle with the Fengyu Tower’s people before this, and we dealt him a heavy blow. Anyone who encounters him now can easily kill him.”

Brother Wu thought it over and agreed. Before they arrived, Yang Kai had already fought Nu Lang, consuming much energy. They had seen his injuries with their own eyes. The harsh environment here forced him to expend Primordial Qi and spirit to resist the Yin energy’s invasion. His strength was likely reduced by seventy to eighty percent. If they met him now, killing him would be easy.

In this situation, it was less about avenging Senior Brother Cai and more about seizing the Earth-Grade secret treasure in Yang Kai’s hands. Whoever found him first would claim the treasure. How could they act together?

With this thought, Brother Wu’s breath grew heated.
