## Chapter 3 — The Man Who Has Lost One Hundred Forty-Seven Consecutive Battles

Among the disciples of Lingxiao Pavilion, internal strife was common, and every year, many would perish. Yet Zhou Dingjun, watching this senior brother before him who pressed forward fearlessly without retreat, could not help but feel a slight stir within his heart.

If he were in such a position, Zhou Dingjun believed he himself could not reach such resolve; he would likely concede defeat once realizing he was outmatched.

"Preserving one's strength for future opportunities" is the way of the world. "Not turning back unless hitting a brick wall"—this is a form of persistence!

Seeing Yang Kai’s haggard figure, yet his fighting spirit growing stronger by the moment, Zhou Dingjun knew that unless he knocked him unconscious, today’s matter would not be over.

With this thought, Zhou Dingjun swung his hand and struck Yang Kai’s neck bone with a palm blade as he charged forward. Yang Kai’s fierce aura instantly dissipated; his eyes dulled, and his entire body sagged weakly to the ground.

At this scene, a person standing atop the canopy of a large tree some dozens of zhang away took out a small booklet and casually flipped it open to a page. Written there was: Trial Disciple Yang Kai versus Outer Disciple Zhou Dingjun, Zhou Dingjun victory.

The figure on the treetop was slender and graceful, obviously a woman, though her face was concealed by a black veil. However, her delicate eyebrows revealed her youth. The leaf armband she wore on her arm marked her identity as a Shadow Hall Disciple of Lingxiao Pavilion!

The Shadow Hall of Lingxiao Pavilion was a special institution, governed by the three Elders of the Sect. Its disciples were responsible for recording matters large and small within the Sect, including the outcomes of duels between disciples.

Thus, when challenging within Lingxiao Pavilion, one need not worry about not receiving contribution points for a victory; the Shadow Hall disciples hidden in the shadows would surely record the results and compile reports monthly.

After recording this battle’s outcome, the Shadow Hall woman pulled out a smaller booklet from her waist and glanced at a page. It read: Jihe Fourteenth Year, May Seventh, Yang Kai’s 147th battle, defeat!

Aside from the newly added line, the page was densely filled with the records of all Yang Kai’s battles, each noting the date and battle number—all with the same result: defeat!

One hundred and forty-seven consecutive defeats without a single victory—a record that could be described as unprecedented since the founding of Lingxiao Pavilion. This record was earth-shattering, unheard of before or since, and yet the creator of this record was quietly lying on the ground, life uncertain.

Yang Kai never sought out challenges; all one hundred forty-seven battles were challenges thrown at him by others. In other words, he was challenged once every five days, a routine persisting for more than two years.

Looking down at Yang Kai on the ground, Xia Ningshang’s delicate brows furrowed slightly. She could not understand why Yang Kai would persist to such an extent. He had already been reduced to a Trial Disciple of Lingxiao Pavilion; even his survival and basic sustenance were in question. Why did he still remain within Lingxiao Pavilion? Surely if he left, his life would improve. What kind of stubbornness dwelled in the heart of this thin youth that enabled him to endure one hundred and forty-seven defeats without discouragement?

Perhaps this was the foolishness of a man?

Xia Ningshang’s noticing of Yang Kai was just a coincidence. As a Shadow Hall Disciple, she was assigned to oversee this area. She had seen each time Yang Kai was challenged, each time he was knocked unconscious. One or two times were no issue, but after so many times, she began to pay special attention to this Third Stage of Body Tempering youth.

She was curious to see how long he would persist in Lingxiao Pavilion with such determination. His talent and cultivation speed were entirely unsuitable for this martial world; the realm of ordinary people was his true home.

Below, the crowd had long since dispersed, leaving only Yang Kai unconscious on the ground. People came and went; time passed.

In a flash, Xia Ningshang’s figure vanished from the treetop.

When Yang Kai awoke again, the sun was already high in the sky. His entire body ached painfully as he staggered to his feet. Looking around, he realized that he was no longer where he had blacked out, but beneath the shade of a nearby large tree.

How strange—could it be that some kind-hearted senior brother had carried him here? Such a thing had never happened before. Yang Kai scratched his head in puzzlement, vaguely recalling a blurry figure swaying before his eyes as he lost consciousness, but the memory was too vague and elusive.

But between where he now stood and where he had lost consciousness, there was a distinct dragging trail—a clear mark caused by someone dragging a body on the ground.

Feeling his back, a burning pain spread fiercely.

Yang Kai froze, then immediately grew angry! Any goodwill he had harbored toward this unknown benefactor vanished instantly. This person must have dragged him here directly, which was why the skin on his back was rubbed raw and bleeding.

Better to have just left him there and ignored him, Yang Kai thought bitterly.

Just then, he suddenly realized his right hand was still clutching something. Curious, he looked down to find a finely crafted small porcelain bottle in his grasp.

What was this? This bottle absolutely wasn’t his. Yang Kai carried nothing but the clothes on his back and the broom he used for sweeping—how could he have such a thing?

A label was stuck to the small bottle, and upon careful examination, Yang Kai murmured: “Coagulation & Bruise-Dispelling Ointment!”

Yang Kai was familiar with this ointment.

It was a plaster for treating external injuries used in Lingxiao Pavilion. Though far from miraculous, it had a remarkable effect on injuries. Every disciple carried a bottle with them for emergencies. Even so, this minor remedy was not cheap in Lingxiao Pavilion’s logistics.

Ten Sect Contribution Points per bottle!

How much contribution could Yang Kai earn from sweeping for a month? Exactly ten points! Thus the value of the ointment in his hand was equal to an entire month’s worth of his sweeping labor!

Who? At this moment, a fierce wave of gratitude surged through Yang Kai’s heart, and the pain in his back eased considerably. Having spent three years in Lingxiao Pavilion, Yang Kai had long since grown accustomed to the cold indifference and mercilessness among disciples, the fickleness of the world. Yet today, someone had left behind a bottle of Coagulation & Bruise-Dispelling Ointment after he was injured. This simple act deeply moved him.

It turned out that not all disciples of this Sect were heartless.

For that person, this small bottle might mean little, but to Yang Kai, it was exactly what he needed most.

There is a saying: “A single drop of water remembered gratefully; when prosperous, repay with gushing springs.”

Moved, Yang Kai tried hard to recall the figure, but the image only grew more blurred. Instead, a faint fragrance lingered gently at his nostrils, refusing to dissipate for a long time.

“So the ointment actually smells nice?” Yang Kai suddenly realized with new knowledge.

Calming himself, straightening his clothes, he carefully pocketed the bottle of Coagulation & Bruise-Dispelling Ointment. Grabbing his broom, Yang Kai resumed his sweeping duties.

He swept both inside and outside until noon, finally finishing his work for the day. Weary and hungry, Yang Kai returned to his small room.

His wounds from the morning’s battle remained untreated. Though hungry, Yang Kai could only endure and focus on treating his injuries first.

Taking off his azure clothes, Yang Kai brought a basin of clean water to wash himself. If anyone had seen his physical condition then, they would have been greatly shocked.

Yang Kai’s body was frail and thin; his ribs were clearly visible beneath the skin. His entire frame appeared emaciated, yet upon this malnourished body were bruises everywhere, scars covering almost every inch—few places remained unblemished.

Being challenged every five days, each time defeated and knocked unconscious; old wounds never healed before new ones were added. Anyone else would not be able to endure such pain. Yet Yang Kai persisted—not only enduring but continuing his cultivation and sweeping without any impact from these injuries.
