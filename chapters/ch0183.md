## Chapter 183 — Heart of a Snake and Scorpion

Originally, it was thought that finding the Hidden Island would ensure that the Yunxia Sect would become renowned throughout the world. However, now that their large ship had been shattered, even if the survivors obtained some treasures on this Hidden Island, how would they return to the Yunxia Sect?

Without that sturdy ship, even a master in the Divine Roaming Realm would find it impossible to leap across the nearly ten thousand li.

A sense of sorrow and faint unease surged within the hearts of the three disciples from the Yunxia Sect. All of them were young and had never encountered any significant hardships. This day, they were first attacked by a demon beast from the sea and witnessed countless elders perish before their eyes. Human lives were as fragile as ants. Had it not been for their good fortune, they too would have ended up like those people, their corpses becoming the prey of fish and beasts. Having narrowly escaped death, they now found themselves trapped on this deserted island, with no hope of returning home, naturally feeling despondent.

“Senior Sister Qing, don’t worry. Junior Brother will definitely find a way to bring you all back,” Miao Lin, well-versed in the art of wooing, despite feeling panic inside, knew this was the best time to showcase himself. He quickly spoke up, his earnestness evident.

Yu Aoqing, already in a bad mood, couldn’t help but sneer at his boastfulness. “What ability do you have to take me away? Can you build a sturdy ship to withstand the demon beasts’ attacks?”

“I can’t.” Miao Lin’s face flushed at the question.

“Then can you leap across this vast distance?” Yu Aoqing pressed further.

“I can’t either…”

“Then shut your mouth!” Yu Aoqing vented all the anger she had bottled up during their time on the ship. If it weren’t for their current predicament, she might have already taken action against Miao Lin.

Zhang Yu quickly intervened, “Senior Sister Qing, don’t be angry. Miao Lin was just speaking casually.”

“Hmph!” Yu Aoqing flicked her hair and turned, walking along the beach while coldly saying, “No skills yet trying to act like a hero, completely overestimating yourself!”

Zhang Yu hurriedly followed.

Miao Lin, who had tried to offer comfort, felt his face darken after being mocked by Yu Aoqing. He muttered under his breath. A flicker of resentment crossed his eyes, and then he turned to glance at Yang Kai, a murderous intent brewing, seemingly wanting to vent his anger on him.

“Bring him along!” Yu Aoqing’s icy voice came from ahead.

Miao Lin quickly responded, casting a resentful glance at Yang Kai before shoving him forward.

The four of them walked along the beach in a certain direction. Although Yu Aoqing hadn’t stated her intentions, Yang Kai understood she wanted to search for the scattered disciples of the Yunxia Sect who had fled in panic.

This was undoubtedly the right course of action. They were currently isolated and without elders to support them, so it was only natural to seek out others to regroup.

However, after walking along the beach for an entire day, they had only found four other unfortunate souls. Among them, only two were disciples of the Yunxia Sect, while the other two were ordinary people. The rest had scattered to who knows where.

Their group had grown to eight people, but their overall strength hadn’t increased much, as the five Yunxia Sect disciples were all from the younger generation.

The last two Yunxia Sect disciples they found were a man named Qi Yuan and a woman named Luo Qianqian. Neither was particularly strong, their cultivation levels hovering between the peak of the Qi Movement Realm and the Separation and Union Realm.

Without any elders, Yu Aoqing appeared somewhat flustered. Among the five Yunxia Sect disciples, her strength was the highest, having reached the sixth layer of the Separation and Union Realm. The others were all weaker than her. Moreover, she usually held a high status within the Yunxia Sect, so everyone naturally looked to her for guidance, hoping she would lead them out of this predicament. The burden on her shoulders made her feel somewhat at a loss.

At night, the three ordinary people were instructed by the Yunxia Sect disciples to gather some firewood, and they lit a bonfire by the beach. The group gathered together to discuss their next steps.

Some suggested searching for the elders, while others said they should stay put and wait for someone to find them. Opinions were not unified.

In the end, it was still Yu Aoqing who spoke up, “Since we’ve entered the Hidden Island, we shouldn’t waste this opportunity. Tomorrow, we’ll venture into the island to explore. Perhaps we might encounter our masters. Even if we don’t, if we obtain some fortune, we might be able to leave this place and return to Yunxia.”

Everyone felt that Yu Aoqing’s reasoning was sound, and the wealth and opportunities hidden within the island were also the biggest reasons for their excitement.

After they finished discussing, Yang Kai finally spoke hesitantly, “A few esteemed ones, if you enter the island, could you not take us three along? We’re just fishermen from the seaside. If we encounter any dangers inside, we wouldn’t be able to fight like you and would only become a burden…”

The other two ordinary people shared the same thoughts but lacked Yang Kai’s courage to voice them. Upon hearing him, they all looked at Yu Aoqing with some expectation.

They knew that the decision lay in Yu Aoqing’s hands.

Zhang Yu frowned slightly and nodded, “Indeed, bringing you along would be a burden.”

Originally, she thought Yu Aoqing would agree to leave the three ordinary people behind, but unexpectedly, after a brief contemplation, Yu Aoqing shook her head and smiled lightly, “You came with us from the Yunxia Sect. Leaving you here might lead to some danger. It’s better for you to follow us. There’s still hope of surviving.”

Bitch! Yang Kai cursed inwardly. How could he not know what Yu Aoqing was plotting? This beautiful yet venomous woman was certainly not acting out of kindness.

Though he thought this in his heart, he had to express gratitude outwardly, silently lamenting that he would likely have to stay with the Yunxia Sect people for some time.

This was fine; after all, he was unfamiliar with this Hidden Island and could follow them to explore the situation. When danger arose, would he not find an opportunity to escape?

At night, the five disciples of the Yunxia Sect took turns keeping watch.

The next day, the group of eight set foot into the Hidden Island to explore.

As soon as they entered the island, Yu Aoqing revealed her true intentions, ordering one of the ordinary people to walk ahead to scout the path, while the others followed behind.

Though this person was terrified, he had no choice but to obey under Yu Aoqing’s threat.

Only at this moment did everyone realize why Yu Aoqing insisted on bringing the ordinary people along; it was to use them as scouts.

After walking for a long time, they ventured deeper into the island. Towering ancient trees surrounded them, swaying ominously, and the rustling sounds filled them with dread. The ordinary person leading the way, like a startled bird, suddenly felt weak in the legs and collapsed to the ground, crying out for mercy.

The Yunxia disciples ignored him, continuing to threaten him. After a long while, he finally mustered the courage to move forward again.

By noon, they suddenly came upon a row of fruit trees bearing bright red fruits. No one knew what kind of fruit it was, but it smelled quite fragrant.

Exhausted and hungry, the group couldn’t help but swallow their saliva at the sight of so many fruits.

Luo Qianqian reached out to pick one, just as Yu Aoqing coldly shouted, “Slow down!”

Luo Qianqian paused, looking at her in confusion. “What’s wrong?”

With a frosty expression, Yu Aoqing took the fruit and glanced at the three ordinary people.

Seeing her expression, everyone understood what she was planning.

Not knowing whether the fruit was poisonous, the best method was to find someone to taste it. The two ordinary people became flustered, not daring to meet her gaze, while Yang Kai pretended to be the same.

Yet, Yu Aoqing had her sights set on Yang Kai, walking up to him and shoving the fruit into his hands. “Eat it.”

Yang Kai suppressed his anger and looked down at the fruit in his hand. He sniffed it and instinctively felt it was not poisonous, but in this world, there were both beneficial and harmful things; who could say for sure?

“Eat it, it’s not poisonous.” The Earth Demon’s voice came through, “This little girl is truly not a good person.”

“You recognize this?” Yang Kai asked, feeling uneasy.

“Yeah.”

Without the Earth Demon’s reminder, Yang Kai would have caused a scene even at the risk of exposing his identity. But since the Earth Demon said it was not poisonous, he could naturally eat it, especially since he was hungry.

With some assurance in his heart, he still put on a troubled expression. Looking at the fruit in his hand, it seemed like the most potent poison. Under Yu Aoqing’s repeated urging, he reluctantly took a bite.

It had a fragrant taste, sweet on the tongue, somewhat like a ripe persimmon but much chewier.

“Eat more.” Yu Aoqing ordered coldly.

“Earth Demon, if I can kill this woman, you must torment her soul thoroughly,” Yang Kai secretly vowed.

“Old servant obeys!” the Earth Demon chuckled.

After waiting for Yang Kai to finish the entire fruit, the other seven people remained silent, all staring at his reaction with eager eyes.

Half an hour later, seeing that Yang Kai was still fine, Yu Aoqing couldn’t help but breathe a sigh of relief and waved her hand, “You can eat now. We’ll rest here for a moment before continuing on our way.”

Upon hearing her words, Miao Lin and Qi Yuan hurriedly stepped forward to pick fruits, while the three female disciples of the Yunxia Sect did not move. In no time, Miao Lin and Qi Yuan had gathered a lot of fruits and eagerly handed them to the three women.

Miao Lin generously praised, “It’s still Senior Sister Qing who is thoughtful. If it weren’t for you leading us this time, we might have been poisoned to death in just a few days.”

Zhang Yu also chimed in, “Yes, I’ve heard Senior Sister Qing is exceptionally wise. Today, seeing is believing; you truly live up to your reputation.”

Hearing such praise, a faint smile appeared on Yu Aoqing’s cold face.

The five from the Yunxia Sect feasted happily, while Yang Kai and the other two ordinary people also busied themselves, stuffing their mouths with the fruits.

This row of fruit trees bore plenty of fruit, and the eight of them quickly devoured all of it.

After filling their stomachs, they set off again. Perhaps it was because Yang Kai had taken the risk of tasting the fruit, the person leading the way this time was not him but another ordinary person.

Not long after, Qi Yuan suddenly pointed to the side and exclaimed, “Look over there! Something is shining!”

Everyone followed his gaze and indeed saw a flicker of light in the grass nearby.

“Let’s go take a look.” Yu Aoqing commanded.

Soon, they arrived about thirty zhang away from the source of the light. Yu Aoqing’s cautious nature was once again evident, as she ordered another ordinary person to go forward to investigate while she remained in place.
