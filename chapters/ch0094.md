## Chapter 94 — Seal

With Xia Ningshang’s movements, the dense Yin energy throughout the valley began to stir. From above, it resembled a pot of boiling water, the Yin energy seeming to possess life as it churned and writhed ceaselessly within the valley. The scene was utterly terrifying.

“Not good!” Wen Feichen shouted in alarm. Though he did not fully understand what Xia Ningshang was doing, as a True Yuan Realm expert at the fifth stage, he still had some insight.

This woman had likely set up some formation within the valley beforehand, and now she was activating the great array.

If she truly succeeded in launching this unknown formation, this matter would surely take a turn for the worse.

“Put more effort in! Break through that light barrier immediately!” Wen Feichen roared. He had to capture Xia Ningshang before the great array was fully activated; otherwise, all would be lost.

“Come over here, or I’ll kill you all right now!” Wen Feichen barked at the minor figures from Fengyu Tower.

Nu Lang and the others dared not hesitate. Such a fierce battle was beyond their abilities, and they knew their limits, having stood aside to watch the drama unfold. But at Wen Feichen’s command, they had no choice but to join in.

Their attacks were weak, but they could at least chip away at the light barrier’s defenses.

The twelve of them exerted every ounce of strength, attacking the semicircular light barrier with reckless abandon.

Ripples spread across the light barrier in layers, appearing on the verge of collapse, yet it remained steadfast.

Inside the barrier, Yang Kai was burning with anxiety. He wished to help, but his strength was too low to intervene. He could only guard Xia Ningshang, ready to lend what little aid he could if the barrier were breached.

Xia Ningshang’s movements quickened, her hands blurring into afterimages. The valley was filled with howling Yin winds, growing ever fiercer, sounding like the wails of ghosts and wolves, chilling to the bone.

Wen Feichen’s expression was grave, tinged with greed. He realized he had underestimated the grade of this defensive treasure. It was at least a Heaven-Grade Upper-Level defensive artifact; otherwise, it could not have withstood so long without breaking.

A Heaven-Grade Upper-Level defensive treasure—enough to withstand the full might of a Divine Roaming Realm expert’s strike. Possessing such an item was tantamount to having a second life.

After the time it takes to burn an incense stick, a small crack suddenly appeared on the light barrier.

With the crack’s appearance, Xia Ningshang’s complexion paled! Activating this defensive treasure had consumed a great deal of her Yuan Qi. Now, having to simultaneously activate her prior arrangements, her internal Yuan Qi flowed out like a breached dam, rapidly draining.

Seeing hope, Wen Feichen urged his comrades to attack relentlessly while unleashing a powerful strike himself. His Yuan Qi surged violently as he slowly thrust a palm forward.

The palm struck the light barrier, causing it to tremble violently. Xia Ningshang’s delicate body shuddered, her face growing even paler.

Crackling sounds echoed as spiderweb-like fractures spread densely across the barrier.

“Hahaha!” Wen Feichen laughed heartily. He was confident that with one more full-strength strike, the barrier would be completely shattered.

But before he could deliver his next palm, the churning Yin energy in the valley abruptly stilled, and the ghostly howls vanished in an instant.

In Xia Ningshang’s starry, clear eyes flickered a sharp light as she cried out, “Seal!”

At that moment, her preparations were finally complete.

Clatter… Above the valley, the sound of chains being whipped through the air suddenly arose, like a soul-capturing melody.

Startled, all looked up to see several long, thick, black chains flying through the air, each several zhang in length. These chains were formed entirely of dense Yin energy, radiating a chilling aura that sent shivers down the spine.

The Yin energy chains circled above the heads of the Blood Battle Gang and Fengyu Tower members. In the next moment, as if possessed of spirit, they lunged downward.

Wen Feichen’s face changed drastically, realizing he was too late. Hastily, he struck the light barrier with a palm.

At the same time, Xia Ningshang’s body trembled, no longer able to sustain the activation of her Heaven-Grade treasure.

That palm strike flew straight toward her without any obstruction.

At this critical moment, Yang Kai, who had been vigilantly watching nearby, seized the chance. Before the palm could strike Xia Ningshang, he grabbed her and pulled her away. Yet she was still grazed by the edge of the strike, causing her body to tremble and her face to turn pale. Yang Kai caught her around the waist and fled swiftly without looking back.

The enemy’s numbers were too great, their strength too formidable. He was not foolish enough to confront them head-on.

As Yang Kai fled with Xia Ningshang, the Yin energy chains finally ensnared the Blood Battle Gang’s experts.

There were only eight chains in total. Wen Feichen, who had been the focus of Xia Ningshang’s attention, was targeted by three chains alone. The remaining five chains flew toward the Blood Battle Gang’s Separation and Union Realm and Qi Movement Realm experts.

Those ensnared were horrified, believing their lives were at an end. Yet, unexpectedly, the chains vanished directly into their bodies, all eight disappearing without a trace.

Wen Feichen suddenly felt an invisible force suppressing his True Yuan Realm strength. He groaned and spat a mouthful of blood.

The three Separation and Union Realm experts and one slightly stronger Qi Movement Realm disciple suffered the same fate, their faces turning deathly pale as they coughed up blood uncontrollably.

The last Qi Movement Realm disciple, weaker than the rest, lost all breath in an instant and collapsed dead.

“What’s going on?” Long Hui roared in fury. Just moments ago, the situation had been favorable, and they were on the verge of breaking the opponent’s Heaven-Grade treasure. He had already been fantasizing about how to humiliate Xia Ningshang. But in the blink of an eye, they had lost one man, five were severely injured, and even Wen Feichen looked dispirited!

How could Long Hui not be enraged? The prize was snatched away at the last moment!

“Young Master Long, please calm down,” Wen Feichen gritted his teeth through the pain, circulating his Yuan Qi to dispel the chill. His voice was weak as he explained, “That woman must have set something up here beforehand. She used the power of the formation against us. We were careless and let her succeed.”

“Trash! All of you are trash!” Long Hui exploded, cursing loudly. “So many of us against one woman, and yet we were utterly defeated.”

A flash of anger crossed Wen Feichen’s face, but he suppressed it and said, “Though we were outwitted, that woman is in no better shape. She must be completely drained of Yuan Qi. If we can catch up to them now, they will be like lambs to the slaughter!”

“Then what are we waiting for? Let’s give chase!” Long Hui urged impatiently.

Wen Feichen turned his gaze to the group of minor figures from Fengyu Tower, his face darkening. “I’ll give you a chance to live. If you can capture that woman and bring her back, I, Wen Feichen, will personally ensure your safe departure from here!”

Earlier, Xia Ningshang’s eight chains had targeted only the Blood Battle Gang’s experts, leaving the Fengyu Tower group unharmed. Five had entered the valley alive, and all five remained in good condition, far better off than the Blood Battle Gang.
