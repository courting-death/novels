## Chapter 32 — True Yang Technique

Who poisoned us? Why would someone resort to poison?

Just as these questions swirled in his mind, a voice of surprise suddenly rang in his ear: “Huh?”

It was Yang Kai’s voice! Su Mu hated Yang Kai with a burning passion—how could he not recognize it?

So it was him. The poison was his doing. The scoundrel! We only intended to teach you a lesson, yet you dared to use poison! Such cruelty!

Though Su Mu’s mind was filled with curses for Yang Kai, his consciousness quickly began to fade.

Damn it, am I really going to die so foolishly? Such a pity—my grand ambitions, my lofty plans, all cut short here. Heaven truly envies talent, heaven envies talent!

Yang Kai approached the group with light steps, crouched down, and pulled off their face coverings. Looking closely, they were all familiar faces.

After some thought, Yang Kai understood their purpose. They must have suffered greatly at his hands these past days and came tonight to launch a surprise attack in revenge.

But fortune was not on their side.

Yang Kai weighed the incense burner in his hand, a wry smile tugging at his lips.

This was truly an accident. Every night before sleep, Yang Kai would store the incense burner inside his Wordless Black Book. But tonight, after an extended training session, he had grown weary and accidentally fell asleep without putting it away. The herbs inside had not yet been fully consumed, and by chance, Su Mu and the others came to sniff the fragrance.

The exotic aroma emanating from the incense burner was immensely potent. The first time Yang Kai inhaled it, he barely managed three steps before collapsing. Even with his Proud Bone Golden Body, it was overwhelming—let alone for Su Mu and his companions.

Without the support of the Proud Bone Golden Body, they would require several days of recuperation to recover.

Though Yang Kai bore some responsibility for his negligence, the root cause lay in their carelessness. Had they held their breath the moment they caught the scent, they might have avoided such a miserable fate.

“Sigh, why make things so difficult?” Yang Kai sighed, tucking the incense burner back into the Wordless Black Book. He looked down at the sprawled figures, a hint of embarrassment on his face.

After a moment’s thought, he dragged them all outside, dumped them carelessly in a random spot, and left them be.

Returning to his wooden hut, Yang Kai resumed his rest.

Today’s incident served as a warning. He needed to break through the Body Tempering Realm as soon as possible. For now, the incense burner could only be used externally. But if he reached the Open Origin Realm, it would no longer be so troublesome. At that point, even if the incense burner remained inside the Wordless Black Book, it would still function—as long as his internal Yuan Qi could connect to the book.

Over the next few days, Yang Kai trained diligently, rationing the two herbs carefully, though their supply steadily dwindled.

On the morning three days later, after finishing his Body Tempering Chapter exercises, a breath of purple light rose in the east. Suddenly, the Qi Sense within his meridians stirred vigorously, as if countless tiny insects were scurrying and pulsating through his channels.

Yang Kai’s expression grew solemn as he focused his senses.

The pulsation of Qi Sense stirred his flesh and blood, sending a tingling numbness throughout his body—an indescribable blend of itchiness and comfort. He lost track of time as this sensation persisted, until suddenly, his body felt light, and a warmth blossomed in his abdomen. At the same moment, the pulsation vanished without a trace.

His mind conveyed a thought, and the warmth in his abdomen seemed to come alive, dancing with joy.

Yuan Qi! He had finally taken this crucial step. At the seventh stage of the Body Tempering Realm, Yuan Qi was born within the body—an unmistakable sign.

The first wisp of Yuan Qi in a lifetime always emerges in the Dantian. At this stage, the Yuan Qi was still insignificant, incapable of supporting a warrior in battle. Once used, this wisp would vanish, and since the internal cycle was not yet open, refining another would be arduous.

Yet, with Yuan Qi born inside, a warrior could begin cultivating martial techniques.

These were not the basic Long Fist or Whip Kick of Lingxiao Pavilion. Martial techniques were moves empowered by Yuan Qi, the very foundation of combat.

A punch thrown by a sixth-stage Body Tempering warrior might deliver two hundred jin of force, but with the aid of Yuan Qi at the seventh stage, that same punch could unleash five hundred or even a thousand jin.

Of course, at the Body Tempering Realm, warriors seldom used martial techniques freely, as Yuan Qi was difficult to replenish. Only upon reaching the Open Origin Realm could one wield Yuan Qi at will, and even if depleted, it could be quickly restored through cultivation.

The root of all this lay in the ability to recover swiftly.

Thus, from the seventh stage of the Body Tempering Realm onward, a warrior’s task was to use this wisp of Yuan Qi as a foundation to expand and strengthen it.

The most common method was to cultivate martial techniques.

Every martial technique required the Yuan Qi of several or even dozens of meridians to flow in a specific sequence and route, forming unique moves.

By cultivating martial techniques to expand Yuan Qi and open the internal cycle, a warrior could reach the Open Origin Realm—this was the path all warriors followed.

Yang Kai was no exception.

Knowing he had reached the seventh stage of the Body Tempering Realm, he quickly calmed his excitement and hurried back inside to summon the No-Word Black Book.

He flipped directly to the fourth page and began to sense it carefully.

Since his previous breakthroughs, he had tried to break the seal on this page but had never succeeded. Yang Kai guessed that only upon reaching the seventh stage—the watershed of the Body Tempering Realm—would the fourth page reveal its secrets.

His guess proved correct.

Within moments, brilliant golden light shimmered across the fourth page. As before, the golden light detached from the page and entered Yang Kai’s mind.

Suddenly, new information flooded his consciousness: the True Yang Technique! This was the gift bestowed by the Black Book after his breakthrough. As he examined it more closely, his expression grew strange.

The True Yang Technique differed from ordinary martial techniques. Most martial techniques had fixed sequences of moves—though variations existed, they all adhered to a fundamental framework. Deviate too far, and it was no longer the same technique.

But the True Yang Technique had none of this. It had no fixed sequences, endlessly mutable, essentially formless.

This was the first difference.

The True Yang Technique was simple to cultivate but demanded specific conditions.

It required an environment rich in Yang energy to be practiced.

Moreover, when the True Yang Yuan Qi cultivated through this technique reached a certain level within the body, it would condense into liquid Qi, accumulating in the Dantian.

No other martial technique or formula could achieve this. Every warrior’s body had a saturation point; once reached, no more Yuan Qi could be added unless one broke through their limits.
