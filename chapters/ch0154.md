## Chapter 154 — Evil Technique?

Yang Kai truly found it hard to get angry. He plopped down in front of Su Yan again and sighed, “Su Yan, you really don’t have the demeanor of a Senior Sister.”

“You’ve already called me by my name directly, so why should I still act like a Senior Sister?”

Yang Kai was left speechless. He had never realized that this woman, as cold as snow, could also be so sharp-tongued.

Is this the nature of women?

However, after this exchange of banter, their relationship had drawn significantly closer, an effect that even the day he saved her had not achieved.

With a bitter smile, Yang Kai raised his hands in surrender, “Alright, alright, I was wrong!”

Seeing him so slick with words, Su Yan turned serious and said, “Since you’ve decided to accept, let’s begin.”

It was clear that she was still a bit nervous, but it was much better than before.

“How do we proceed?” Yang Kai asked earnestly.

“Channel your Yang attribute technique.” Su Yan closed her eyes, and her Ice Heart Technique began to operate, gradually emitting a bone-chilling coldness.

Yang Kai quickly activated his True Yang Technique, the scorching True Yang Primordial Qi flowing through his meridians.

Once the two opposing techniques began to operate, the entire great hall reacted abnormally, with a continuous rumbling sound echoing.

Upon hearing this commotion, Su Yan’s expression brightened, realizing that her previous deduction was correct. Neither she nor Yang Kai alone could obtain the inheritance of this place; only by both of them channeling their energies simultaneously could they have a chance of success.

As time passed, the energy ball floating above their heads began to react, as if being drawn by an unseen hand, slowly descending.

The dragon-shaped phoenix seal within the energy ball flickered incessantly, transforming and changing, with the rapidly flashing images overwhelming the senses.

After half an hour, the energy ball, towering over ten zhang, finally settled between the two of them. The dragon-shaped phoenix seal flickered even more rapidly, the red and white light flowing continuously, creating a misty glow.

Accompanied by a high-pitched dragon’s roar and a clear phoenix’s cry, the energy ball suddenly exploded into two, transforming into a fire dragon and an ice phoenix, dispersing and rushing into Yang Kai and Su Yan’s bodies.

Both of them shuddered, a look of painful struggle appearing between their brows.

On Yang Kai’s side, when the fire dragon surged into his body, he suddenly discovered that an overwhelming and powerful Yang attribute energy had appeared in his meridians. At the same time, some information flooded into his mind.

Not daring to be negligent, he operated the True Yang Technique frantically, trying to convert that energy into Yang Liquid.

But to his shock, his True Yang Technique could not transform this energy at all. No matter how hard he tried, it wouldn’t turn into Yang Liquid and sink into his Dantian as usual.

With the impact of this surging energy, his meridians and flesh felt as if they were being burned, a strange stirring rising from his heart.

His five senses became extraordinarily sharp, and Yang Kai clearly caught a faint fragrance wafting from not far in front of him. This fragrance was Su Yan’s body scent, entering his nose like a mysterious energy, stirring his heart, quickening his heartbeat, and causing his blood to boil and flow faster.

This was a primitive impulse and desire.

How could this be? Yang Kai’s mind shook violently, and he hurriedly checked the information that had merged into his mind along with the fire dragon. After a moment, his expression turned strange.

Opening his eyes, he happened to catch Su Yan’s gaze directed at him.

Unlike Yang Kai, who was burning with heat, Su Yan’s face was pale, her delicate body trembling uncontrollably, her teeth chattering.

She was frozen.

Having cultivated the Ice Heart Technique, coldness was her best companion, but this level of cold had surpassed her limits, causing her to exhibit reactions she normally wouldn’t have, just as the heat had exceeded Yang Kai’s limits.

Yet Yang Kai could clearly see a faint blush on Su Yan’s pale face, her breathing slightly heavy, and in her star-like eyes, a hint of springtime affection surged.

As their eyes met, Yang Kai realized that her current feelings were likely the same as his, both infinitely yearning for the energy within each other.

Yang Kai longed for her coldness to soothe his heat, while she craved Yang Kai’s warmth to thaw her chill. This desire was instinctual, arising from the energies of the fire dragon and ice phoenix that surged within them.

However, this instinctive urge had not yet overwhelmed their rationality, allowing them to think and resist.

“Su Yan, the inheritance we obtained…” Yang Kai spoke slowly, licking his lips, feeling as if his throat was on fire, his eyes likely reddened from staring at Su Yan.

“I know.” Su Yan gritted her teeth, a bitter expression on her face. Although she had known that this inheritance required both of them to obtain, she never expected it to manifest in this way.

Yin-Yang Harmony Technique! This was a cultivation method, and just from the name, one could tell how it should be cultivated.

The level of this technique was unknown, but it certainly wouldn’t be low, as Su Yan’s Ice Heart Technique was a time-honored Mystery-Grade technique. If the Ice Heart Technique couldn’t withstand that coldness, the quality of the Yin-Yang Harmony Technique could be imagined.

“This is a dual cultivation technique, right?” When Yang Kai asked this question, his heart couldn’t help but race.

“En.” Su Yan’s response was even more suggestive, her tone resembling a low murmur, stirring Yang Kai’s heart.

“Then isn’t that an evil technique?” Yang Kai felt gloomy. Although he was quite pleased to obtain such an inheritance with Su Yan, if it was an evil technique, that would be a serious problem.

Su Yan couldn’t help but smile bitterly at his shallow understanding, unconsciously shifting her body, her voice trembling as she said, “Dual cultivation does not equal evil technique. Absorbing Yin to replenish Yang and absorbing Yang to replenish Yin is what constitutes an evil technique!”

Under normal circumstances, Su Yan would never discuss such embarrassing topics with a man, but at this moment, she could only patiently clarify for Yang Kai. Even so, she felt quite embarrassed, her face flushed.

“Oh.” Yang Kai couldn’t help but feel relieved, raising his eyes to examine Su Yan. He saw her looking at him gently, her eyes filled with a springtime affection that instantly shattered Yang Kai’s mental defenses. Since he had known Su Yan, she had always been aloof and cold, never showing such a vulnerable gaze. It made one instinctively want to comfort and protect her.

Now, she was no longer the proud daughter of the Lingxiao Pavilion, nor the goddess revered by disciples of the three sects. She was just a woman yearning for the fiery energy within him.

At certain times, men are always easier to waver than women. Every woman inherently carries a sense of determination.

“Su Yan…” Yang Kai looked at her eagerly.

“No…” Su Yan’s brows were filled with painful struggle, yet she still slowly shook her head.

With a sigh, Yang Kai’s expression firmed, and he said, “Then let’s see if we can dissolve the energies within us!”

Upon hearing this, Su Yan looked at him gratefully and nodded slightly. If Yang Kai insisted at this moment, she didn’t know if she could resist that temptation. Yang Kai’s understanding and restraint were enough to earn her gratitude.

The two closed their eyes again, each operating their techniques, attempting to dissolve the cold and heat within.

But as time passed, Yang Kai found that the more they tried to dissolve it, the more intense the heat and desire became, the instinctual urges sweeping over his mind and body like a tidal wave, filling his mind with alluring whispers and saturating his senses with the fragrance of a woman. The air he touched felt as if it had transformed into smooth silk, everything enough to make any weak-willed person instantly succumb.

The fire dragon that had entered his body roared in anger, as if impatient for the cold fusion it craved.

Yang Kai’s skin turned bright red, like a heated iron, his whole being radiating heat. Yet he still gritted his teeth and persevered.

Unyielding and steadfast were his greatest strengths. Even though the temptation before him could sway any man, as long as Su Yan didn’t nod, he wouldn’t take any action.

The fire dragon roared, as if questioning and urging him, its anger fueled by his resistance.

As this roar echoed in his heart, Yang Kai’s consciousness gradually began to fade, his eyes turning red like a lustful bull, his heartbeat reaching an unprecedented frequency, pounding like a war drum, strong and clear, with each breath stirring up waves of heavy heat.

Only one thought circled in his mind: to embrace Su Yan before him and use her coldness to dissolve his heat.

This was not his desire for her, but her coldness’s attraction to his heat!

This attraction was stronger than any aphrodisiac in the world! Yang Kai felt this, and so did Su Yan. Under the interference of the energies within them, both were slowly losing themselves.

Just as his consciousness was about to vanish, Yang Kai hurriedly released the unyielding spirit he had held back for so long.

Unyielding Will!

He would not yield to any pressure; it was also a form of pride!

A warmth seeped from his bones, and his nearly lost consciousness suddenly revived significantly.

In that moment, he heard a sound that stirred his heart, a moan erupting from Su Yan’s throat. This sound, upon entering his ears, nearly caused him to lose himself again.

In a hurry, he opened his eyes and saw Su Yan’s pale face tinged with an alluring flush, her ruby-like lips tightly clenched, her long eyelashes trembling incessantly, her body spasming and shaking.

The air was filled with an indescribable fragrance, one even more intoxicating than Su Yan’s body scent.

“Su Yan, Su Yan!” Yang Kai called out, his voice bursting forth like thunder.

Su Yan’s body trembled, her long eyelashes fluttering slightly as she opened her hazy eyes, glancing at Yang Kai, and gritted her teeth, saying, “I... I can still... you should... hold on a bit longer too.”

“En!” Yang Kai nodded slightly, closing his eyes to continue dissolving the domineering energy within.

Just like before, the raging heat repeatedly assaulted Yang Kai’s body and mind, making it impossible for him to think clearly, leaving only instinctual impulses.

But at the most critical moment, the Proud Bone Golden Body always played its role, allowing Yang Kai to regain clarity for a moment.
