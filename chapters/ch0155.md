## Chapter 155 — Desecration

With the powerful effect of the Proud Bone Golden Body, Yang Kai resisted time and again, but his meridians and flesh were burned with excruciating pain.

He did not know how much longer he could endure, but he was certain that if this continued for too long, he would surely be burned to death. The scorching energy within him was becoming increasingly fierce, to the point where he felt he might not be able to bear it any longer.

It was laughable to think that someone who cultivated the True Yang Technique could actually be burned to death by Yang attribute energy. This was truly a tale for the ages; if he were to speak of it, no one would believe him.

In comparison to Yang Kai, Su Yan was in an even worse state. If it weren't for Yang Kai waking her up whenever her mind cleared, she would have long since been unable to hold on.

Even so, Su Yan's condition was deteriorating rapidly.

After yet another awakening, before Yang Kai could call out to her, he was astonished to find that she had somehow moved to within half a foot of him, half-kneeling before him, breathing heavily, her gaze dazed, reaching out a hand towards his cheek.

It was evident that her movements were unconscious; she was still struggling against it. The delicate hand that reached out was accompanied by a chilling aura, frost forming even on her nails, and her small hand trembled violently.

From time to time, her movements would pause, a look of pain flashing across her face. During these moments, faint groans would escape from her throat.

“Su Yan!” Yang Kai called out, but his voice was much softer than before. He was unsure if it was his own conscience playing tricks on him, but he felt a sense of guilt and unease.

Even with this call, Su Yan's beautiful eyes regained a hint of awareness. She saw her own actions and the pity and tenderness in Yang Kai's gaze.

“I think... I can't hold on any longer,” Su Yan said for the first time, completing a full sentence.

Yang Kai looked at her and smiled slightly, then reached out to grasp her hand.

The moment their hands touched, the fire dragon and ice phoenix within them both emitted a sound akin to dragon roars and phoenix cries. Their bodies trembled, and their Divine Sense quickly returned.

Looking at each other, Yang Kai did not let go, nor did Su Yan; their fingers intertwined, entangled together.

They both understood that if they released each other, they would once again endure the pain and struggle they had just experienced.

An unusual sentiment arose in their hearts, warming both of their bodies.

“Are you sure you won't regret it?” Yang Kai asked with a light laugh, tightening his grip on Su Yan's hand. That small hand was icy cold yet incredibly smooth, providing a comforting sensation.

Su Yan's face flushed, her eyes lowered as she softly replied, “We have both tried our best.”

With a gentle pull, Yang Kai used that strength to bring Su Yan into his embrace, and she settled lightly in his arms. One hand held her delicate hand, while the other wrapped around her waist.

One body was as hot as fire, while the other was as cold as ice; they nestled closely together, as if merging into one. An indescribable feeling surged within their souls.

Though their Divine Senses had regained clarity, the abnormalities within their bodies remained unchanged. It was a yearning and need for each other.

“Su Yan!” Yang Kai whispered, his voice trembling with nervousness.

After all, it was his first time experiencing such a thing, and he did not know how to proceed.

Su Yan remained silent, burying her head in Yang Kai's shoulder.

The two of them stayed in that position for a long time. Finally, Yang Kai extended an arm around her neck and gently laid her down.

As she reclined, Su Yan closed her eyes, her eyelashes fluttering, her expression tense. Her hands clutched tightly at her abdomen, gripping together.

“Don’t be nervous!” Yang Kai chuckled softly. Seeing her like this eased his own tension. While speaking, he took a deep breath and pressed his lips against Su Yan's.

As their lips met, Su Yan's body stiffened.

Yang Kai gently patted her hand, conveying his comfort. After a while, she gradually relaxed.

Only then did Yang Kai pry open her lips, awkwardly exploring.

Uncontrollable whimpers echoed throughout the hall, and Su Yan's hands finally wrapped around Yang Kai's neck, responding passionately.

At this moment, she completely overturned the pure and innocent image Yang Kai had of her. The desire for heat had caused her to lose her former self.

Her clothes were gradually undone, carelessly tossed aside by Yang Kai, a chaotic reflection of their emotions.

When the last piece of clothing was removed, Su Yan's face turned a shade of deep crimson, one hand covering her chest, the other shielding her lower abdomen, trembling once more.

Yang Kai's eyes burned with desire as he gazed at her, secretly lamenting the Creator's generosity and kindness. Su Yan's form seemed to gather the finest essence of the world, perfect without a flaw.

Every inch of her skin radiated an enticing luster akin to porcelain, the jade peaks she protected were just the right size, and her flat abdomen bore no excess flesh, smooth as the finest silk, making one reluctant to part with her.

At this moment, a strange red glow of springtime passion surged across her body.

Yang Kai reached out, removing the arm she had placed over her chest. Su Yan slightly resisted but ultimately acquiesced, her eyelashes trembling even more violently.

Though this entire process was brief, it gave Yang Kai a sense of desecrating the sacred.

If it weren't for the dual cultivation inheritance he had obtained with her, how could he, a mere mortal, have the chance to be so close to such a noble and aloof woman? But now, not only could he be close, he could even possess her!

As this thought arose, Yang Kai could no longer suppress his emotions. A low growl, akin to a wild beast, erupted from his throat as he pulled Su Yan into his arms, sitting up amidst her startled cries, then placing her on his lap.

“Just bear with it; I’ve heard it can be a bit painful!” Yang Kai reminded her.

Su Yan nodded imperceptibly, never daring to open her eyes.

Under Yang Kai's guidance, her body slowly descended.

It felt as if a long spear was gradually piercing her, a tingling sensation spreading throughout her body. Su Yan lost her footing and sat down directly.

This was no small matter; a cry of pain escaped Su Yan's lips, but she quickly bit down and suppressed it, wrapping her arms tightly around Yang Kai's neck, her body spasming and trembling, two tears streaming from the corners of her eyes.

At this moment, she wished she could beat Yang Kai to a pulp.

What did he mean by “a bit painful”? It was clearly a heart-wrenching agony!

Neither moved; they maintained their position.

After a long time, that pain gradually faded, replaced by a strange tingling and emptiness within her body. This was an unprecedented experience, an unparalleled feeling that made her want to twist her body, yet she felt too shy to do so.

“Operate the Dual Cultivation Technique!” Yang Kai's calm voice reached her ears, causing Su Yan's heart to race. She quickly opened her eyes to look at him. She found that although the man before her was filled with beastly desire and his eyes were bloodshot, there was still a hint of calmness mixed with concern and pity in his gaze.

A wave of comfort surged within her heart! Su Yan nodded slightly, and together with Yang Kai, they began to operate the dual cultivation technique they had just acquired.

As the technique commenced, both Yang Kai and Su Yan involuntarily let out a moan. The roaring fire dragon and restless ice phoenix within them suddenly calmed down, and the fatigue in their bodies dissipated, replaced by a sense of ease.

Their bodies were tightly intertwined, and the majestic primordial energy flowed and intertwined within them, merging together.

Though their positions were intimate, the expressions on their faces were solemn and dignified as they focused on guiding the energy's flow, without any other thoughts.

Through their physical connection, Yang Kai could clearly feel Su Yan's strength! The icy energy within her was over a hundred times greater than what he had in his meridians. Compared to her, he felt like a stumbling child, fragile and vulnerable.

Su Yan must have noticed this, so while operating the technique, she dared not go too fast, allowing Yang Kai's will to lead. She feared that if she went too quickly, he would not be able to handle it.

The operation of the technique not only allowed them to sense each other's physical conditions but also facilitated a merging of their spirits. The initial sense of strangeness vanished in an instant, and they both felt as if the other was the most important person in their lives. This feeling was natural, without any awkwardness.

As one cycle after another passed, the fire dragon within Yang Kai and the ice phoenix within Su Yan gradually disappeared. Those two immense energies did not remain in their meridians nor settle in their dantian; it was unclear where they had gone.

Their purpose seemed to be to compel Yang Kai and Su Yan to cultivate the Yin-Yang Dual Cultivation Technique. At this moment, they were indeed cultivating, and they had completed their respective missions.

However, Yang Kai felt that they should not have disappeared; he just did not know where they were hidden.

The Dual Cultivation Technique continued to operate, as Yang Kai's True Yang Yuan Qi and Su Yan's icy energy replaced the fire dragon and ice phoenix, flowing and merging within their meridians.

But due to the vast difference in their strengths, when Yang Kai's primordial energy surged into Su Yan's body, it barely made a ripple, like a stone sinking into the sea, vanishing without a trace.

This realization made Yang Kai feel a bit embarrassed.

“Take it slow, no need to rush!” Su Yan's gentle voice echoed in his mind. It seemed she understood Yang Kai's thoughts and comforted him with kindness.

Yang Kai remained silent, directly detonating ten drops of Yang Liquid within his dantian.

The True Yang Yuan Qi in his meridians surged violently, instantly rushing into Su Yan's body.

“Ah…” Su Yan could not help but exclaim. She had no idea how Yang Kai could suddenly unleash such immense primordial energy. With his Open Origin Realm Eighth Stage cultivation, it was impossible for him to have such a vast reserve.

Before her surprise could fade, another wave of energy, no less than the previous one, surged into her body.

Then came another!

A full thirty drops of Yang Liquid erupted, pushing Yang Kai's meridians to their limits. A wave of soreness coursed through him, fearing that if he pushed any further, his meridians would burst.

If it weren't for the Dual Cultivation Technique, Yang Kai would not dare to be so reckless. Each drop of Yang Liquid was a crystallization of his primordial energy. Detonating just one drop could fill his meridians to capacity. Normally, detonating three drops simultaneously would cause problems for his meridians.

But now, all the primordial energy coexisted within both him and Su Yan. With her strength, she could naturally endure the influx of thirty drops of Yang Liquid.
