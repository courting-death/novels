## Chapter 305 — Playing Big

“Once the fight starts, you leave on your own!” In the standoff, Shan Qingluo suddenly whispered to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai furrowed his brows, seemingly lost in thought, completely ignoring her words.

“Hey…” Shan Qingluo subtly nudged Yang Kai.

Yang Kai snapped back to reality, his expression extremely peculiar, as if deep in contemplation, he softly said, “It seems we still have a chance.”

“What?” Shan Qingluo asked in surprise.

“There’s something down below!” Yang Kai gently stomped the ground.

Earlier, he had secretly released his Divine Sense, hoping to find something useful nearby, but unexpectedly discovered that beneath them, there were numerous life auras.

Moreover… these life auras were densely packed, and many were exceptionally vigorous.

Looking around, he indeed noticed that this place was somewhat different from others; the surroundings were filled with dense forests, yet within a radius of a hundred zhang, not a single blade of grass grew, forming a perfectly circular area!

There must be something strange down there. Although he didn’t know what was below, they had no choice but to take a risk.

At the very least, they needed to drag a few down with them.

“Make your move!” Guo Yuanming, seeing Yang Kai and Shan Qingluo whispering to each other, understood they were likely discussing an escape plan. He didn’t dare delay, shouting angrily, he fiercely activated his True Essence and launched a killing move at them.

Seeing him act, the others naturally followed suit without hesitation.

“Delay for ten breaths!” Yang Kai roared, quickly activating the long-unused Star Mark!

“What are you doing!” Shan Qingluo exclaimed, but without hesitation, she hurriedly revealed a silver bracelet from her wrist, which transformed into a streak of silver light, darting about.

At the same time, a pink cloth fan suddenly appeared in her delicate hand, adorned with exquisite patterns of naked men and women engaged in various passionate poses. These patterns were vividly embroidered, appearing lifelike.

As Shan Qingluo infused her True Essence into the fan, the figures on it seemed to come alive, moving vigorously, accompanied by faint, alluring whispers.

A circle of ethereal light radiated out, enveloping everyone, with Shan Qingluo standing at the center, her face adorned with an enchanting smile. Her graceful figure was showcased, with a proud bosom and a curvaceous rear. She swayed like a delicate willow in the wind, exuding an irresistible charm that enveloped the entire scene.

Everyone present, regardless of gender, whether from Qiu Yimeng’s side or Cangyun Evil Land, momentarily froze, their expressions dazed. Those with slightly lower cultivation levels were utterly entranced, lost in an endless springtime haze, their eyes glazed over, unable to extricate themselves.

Qiu Yimeng and Luo Xiaoman both let out soft moans, their legs going weak as they fell to their knees, a charming flush appearing on their faces…

The figures on the fan seemed to transform into living beings, fiercely burrowing into the minds of the crowd, vividly presenting their passionate encounters and delights before everyone’s eyes.

For young maidens like Qiu Yimeng and Luo Xiaoman, who had yet to experience such things, how could they withstand such a fierce and cruel scene?

Guo Yuanming was horrified, urging his True Essence to resist the attack from the silver bracelet while shouting, “Everyone be careful, it’s the Qingluo Fan!”

The experts of the Divine Roaming Realm also changed color, retreating in embarrassment, desperately resisting the overwhelming allure invading their minds.

They clearly understood the power of this secret treasure. This was a treasure passed down from Shan Qingluo’s lineage, and her very name was derived from it.

With the Qingluo Fan, the dream realm she conjured would be greatly enhanced!

Seeing everyone retreat, Shan Qingluo laughed sweetly, her giggles sounding like a bewitching melody, causing minds to sway.

“Vile maid!” Guo Yuanming cursed angrily, his face reddening like a monkey’s backside, struggling to resist, gritting his teeth, “Let’s see how long you can hold on! Once your True Essence runs out, I’ll strip you bare and toy with you in front of everyone!”

Shan Qingluo’s expression turned cold, forming a seal, causing the silver bracelet’s attacks to accelerate.

Suddenly, a sky full of starlight appeared, as if a starry sky fell from the bright day, sparkling points of light flickering from Yang Kai’s hand, creating mesmerizing Star Marks with every movement!

The fierce and surging waves of True Essence radiated out, the intensity of which even the Divine Roaming Realm experts dared not underestimate.

Guo Yuanming and the others looked at Yang Kai in shock, just in time to see him raise a right hand filled with stars, bringing forth that piece of starry sky.

A strange light flashed in Shan Qingluo’s beautiful eyes as she stared at Yang Kai in astonishment, seemingly not expecting him to possess such a fierce killing move.

If this move were unleashed, no one present in the Divine Roaming Realm would be able to withstand it.

As everyone was struck with horror, Yang Kai’s right hand slowly and eerily descended towards the ground.

“Boom…”

The earth suddenly shook, and Guo Yuanming and the others involuntarily breathed a sigh of relief; they were genuinely afraid Yang Kai would unleash that move on them.

Crack, crack, crack…

The sound of shattering spread, and everyone looked down to see countless cracks suddenly appearing from the spot where Yang Kai’s fist struck, rapidly spreading in all directions.

Guo Yuanming frowned, feeling that something was amiss.

Even if that move were immensely powerful, it shouldn’t produce such an effect.

In a hurry, he released his Divine Sense to investigate, and his expression changed drastically as he exclaimed, “Not good, it’s empty below, and…”

Before he could finish, a loud crash resounded, and the ground within a hundred zhang suddenly collapsed, causing everyone to involuntarily fall downwards.

Yang Kai laughed heartily, “We’re leaving!”

Through his Divine Sense, he sensed that the vigorous beings below had been stirred; if they didn’t leave now, it would be too late.

He reached out and pulled Shan Qingluo’s waist, who shot him a reproachful glance but didn’t resist, and the two soared into the air.

Guo Yuanming and the others would not allow them to escape, so they all took to the skies. Before they could unleash their killing moves, a series of popping sounds suddenly came from below.

It seemed something was being spat out.

“Ah…” a scream rang out, and it was Yuan Shi’s voice. Guo Yuanming was horrified, hurriedly looking down, only to see below a mass of enormous spiders and various colored spider eggs, with Yuan Shi currently ensnared in a web, being dragged down by a spider the size of a calf.

The web looked incredibly tough; even a Second Stage expert of the Divine Roaming Realm like Yuan Shi was unable to break free.

“Puff, puff, puff…”

A group of white substances was sprayed from the mouths of those spiders, suddenly transforming mid-air into large webs that covered the sky, making it impossible to evade.

In just two breaths, most people were wrapped up and fell to the ground, with only a few quick ones managing to escape.

But… it was still too late.

Even Yang Kai and Shan Qingluo were ensnared by several large webs that had been spat out, falling awkwardly downwards.

“What the hell is this!” Yang Kai’s expression changed drastically, activating his True Essence and wildly slashing with the Shura Sword.

The Shura Sword was a Heaven-Grade treasure, its sharpness extraordinary. Even those webs, which ordinary Divine Roaming Realm experts couldn’t break free from, tore apart like silk under the Shura Sword.

“It’s here!” Shan Qingluo looked down and couldn’t help but exclaim, “So it was here.”

“What?” Yang Kai asked suspiciously.

“The thing I came to find is right below!” A glimmer of excitement sparkled in Shan Qingluo’s eyes.

“You’re looking for spiders?” Yang Kai was taken aback, suddenly recalling that Shan Qingluo had mentioned her physique was called Poison Widow.

Isn’t the Poison Widow a spider?

“Not good, these webs are poisonous,” Shan Qingluo suddenly remembered something, her expression changing as she warned.

If she were at the Ninth Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm, she wouldn’t fear these webs, but now her strength had plummeted, and she couldn’t resist the toxin’s invasion. By the time she sensed something was wrong, it was already too late!

“Why didn’t you say so earlier!” Yang Kai felt helpless, also realizing something was off, his body growing weak and unable to muster any strength, his consciousness rapidly blurring.

This was a big mess! Not only had they failed to escape, but they had also trapped themselves.

Although Yang Kai had known beforehand that what lay below was not to be trifled with, he hadn’t expected to provoke so many spiders.

Those giant eight-legged spiders, each larger than a calf, were clearly Sixth-Tier Demonic Beasts! There were at least twenty or thirty of such Demonic Beasts below.

But if they hadn’t acted this way, he and Shan Qingluo wouldn’t have been able to shake off Guo Yuanming and the others’ pursuit. Now it could be said that they had also dragged them down with them, so the situation wasn’t too dire.

Thinking this, Yang Kai’s consciousness gradually faded.

Before completely losing consciousness, Yang Kai pressed his palms together and suddenly unleashed a wisp of ghostly light, striking a nearby poisonous spider.

With a faint smile on his lips, he and Shan Qingluo embraced as they fell to the ground.

That poisonous spider seemed momentarily taken aback before slowly crawling forward, spitting out a mass of webbing to wrap the two and dragging them away.

…

It was unclear how long had passed when Yang Kai finally stirred awake, his body still devoid of strength, unable to move, wrapped tightly in layer upon layer of webs.

Through the faint light filtering in and the blurry images, Yang Kai saw many egg-like entities, densely packed together.

At first glance, they seemed somewhat familiar, and upon closer inspection, they resembled the cocoons Shan Qingluo had produced during her breakthrough a month ago.

Many of the spider eggs showed signs of movement. Yang Kai slightly released his Divine Sense and immediately sensed that several powerful individuals had awakened and were trying to find a way to break free.

But with the spider poison coursing through their bodies, how could they escape?

A rhythmic warmth emanated from his chest, and a faint, alluring fragrance lingered at the tip of his nose. Yang Kai looked down to see a cascade of silky black hair.

Shan Qingluo was nestled in his embrace, deeply asleep, their bodies pressed closely together, his hand resting on her waist, feeling her soft and delicate form, the astonishing elasticity pressing against his chest, causing Yang Kai to feel a stir of emotions.
