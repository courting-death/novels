## Chapter 79 — The Price of a Glance

At this moment, Su Yan was clad only in a chest binder and underpants. Her back was as white and smooth as jade, her rounded hips firm and alluring, and her long, slender legs stretched out before Yang Kai. Vast expanses of snow-white skin were fully exposed, imprinting themselves vividly upon Yang Kai’s gaze.

Even in the night, Yang Kai could see everything clearly.

The curve of her back was flawless, her delicate shoulders radiating an enticing sheen. Her slender waist was exquisitely shaped, accentuating the modest yet perfectly rounded hips. Her translucent skin stirred the blood, and the tight-fitting white underpants clinging to her hip crease provoked endless fantasies.

Because her skin was so pale, and her chest binder and underpants were white as well, at a glance it seemed as if she were entirely naked.

Perhaps hearing the movement behind her, Su Yan raised one hand across her chest and turned half her body toward the door, her other hand holding a pristine white nightgown. It was clear she was in the midst of changing clothes.

Their eyes met in midair. Yang Kai’s expression was one of shock as he lingered for a moment on the full, fair curves she sought to conceal. A flash of killing intent passed through Su Yan’s beautiful eyes, and her delicate shoulders trembled slightly.

For she saw two bloodshot eyes—like ravenous wolves hunting in the snow, like lustful demons—brazenly roaming over her pure and flawless body. Not only that, the man opposite her was panting heavily, as if stirred by some base desire.

Crackling, centered on Su Yan, a layer of frost rapidly spread outward. Her crimson lips pressed tightly together, and her eyes filled with a chilling coldness.

Yang Kai finally realized the danger. He twisted his body and accelerated to his utmost speed, hastily fleeing the scene.

His speed was swift; in less than three breaths, he had burst outside. But before he could discern direction, a loud crash erupted behind him. The house had been shattered, and a pure white figure flew out from the breach, landing before Yang Kai with a cold expression tinged with some shameful anger.

Yang Kai retreated cautiously several steps, adopting a defensive stance. His mind raced, searching for a way to explain. Yet the more he thought, the more he knew he was beyond words—no explanation would suffice now.

No girl, having her body gazed upon in such a way, would let the matter rest so easily!

Su Yan had already dressed, her cold gaze fixed on Yang Kai. Though she had been furious enough to wish him dead moments ago, she knew he likely did not intend this. He probably never imagined she would return from the Black Wind Trade Market and take the room opposite his.

This could only be a misunderstanding! But even so, Su Yan could not simply let it go.

She awaited an explanation—one that could quell her anger.

Yet the man who had ogled her body opposite said nothing, his eyes still bloodshot, radiating a fierce battle intent. He showed no sign of shame or fear before her.

Very well, I need no explanation. I only wish to beat you senseless to vent my anger!

An ice flower quietly blossomed at Su Yan’s fingertip. With a flick, it spun swiftly and flew toward Yang Kai.

Racing through the air, the ice flower grew with the wind. By the time it reached Yang Kai, it had expanded to the size of a basin and moved with great speed.

Yang Kai dared not delay. Bursting forth with True Yang Primordial Qi, he struck the ice flower with a punch.

His fist stung sharply. The cold ice flower’s attribute opposed the Yang nature of his True Yang Qi, and the two forces clashed. With his blow, the basin-sized ice flower shattered instantly.

Swish, swish, swish… The shattered ice flower fragmented into countless ice shards, pelting Yang Kai from all directions.

Caught off guard, Yang Kai was struck by over a dozen wounds, blood flowing freely. His body, still not fully healed, seemed even more fragile.

He growled lowly as his Proud Bone Golden Body flared once more, warmth spreading through him. His strength was slowly recovering.

A flicker of surprise crossed Su Yan’s beautiful eyes. She had expected to knock Yang Kai unconscious with a single strike, yet he had somehow dispelled her attack.

Swaying gracefully, Su Yan approached like a descending celestial maiden. She pointed a finger, striking Yang Kai’s shoulder.

A chilling sensation spread across his shoulder. Yang Kai staggered backward, narrowing his eyes. There, a patch of snow-white frost had appeared, already beginning to crystallize into an ice flower.

Without hesitation, Yang Kai tore open his shirt, then condensed a drop of Yang Liquid at his fingertip and sprinkled it onto his shoulder.

Sizzling sounds followed as his shoulder felt like it was branded by a red-hot iron. The frost rapidly shrank and vanished in the blink of an eye.

Su Yan’s surprise deepened. She had never imagined Yang Kai would use such an unfathomable method to counter her icy strike. Her eyes turned cold as she summoned a thousand-layered snow wave, her lithe figure concealed within it, surging toward Yang Kai.

Like a crushing avalanche, the snow wave roared with overwhelming force, enveloping Yang Kai instantly.

Bone-chilling cold rose from his core. Though he cultivated the True Yang Technique, Yang Kai felt as if he were about to freeze solid into an ice statue.

He knew Su Yan was enraged. Though her attacks bore no killing intent, they clearly aimed to punish him severely.

This suited Yang Kai perfectly. Though his opponent was far beyond his ability to resist, the assault provided an excellent opportunity to comprehend the insights he had just gained.

This opponent was a thousand times better than Su Mu.

Within the snow wave, Su Yan struck repeatedly. Yang Kai was utterly unable to counter. Grunts of pain escaped him, blood trickled from his mouth, and his body trembled violently as he struggled to withstand the invading cold.

In adversity, Yang Kai’s senses sharpened. Suddenly, he ceased resisting and allowed Su Yan’s attacks to batter him.

“What is going on here?” The commotion finally roused the sleeping elders. Second Elder Su Xuanwu was the first to arrive, followed closely by Su Mu leading Li Yuntian and others.

Upon seeing the scene, all drew a sharp breath.

Amid the swirling snow, Yang Kai stood bare-chested, eyes closed, enduring Su Yan’s fierce assault. His seemingly frail body was battered here and there, tossed about in midair, yet he never fell.

“Ugh…” Su Mu gasped. “What has Senior Brother Yang done to provoke Sister?”

“Could it be that Senior Sister is retaliating for what happened a few days ago?” Li Yuntian said, horrified.

“That must be it. Otherwise, with Senior Sister’s temper, she wouldn’t beat Senior Brother Yang like this.”

“Poor Senior Brother Yang. His injuries haven’t healed, yet he suffers such a calamity. Sister’s blows are too harsh.”

Their murmurs reached Su Yan’s ears, stoking her anger further. Today, Yang Kai had looked upon her body, and she had struck to teach him a lesson. But hearing their words, it seemed she was petty and vindictive, settling grudges after the fact.

Su Yan’s attacks grew even fiercer.
