## Chapter 184 — Exposure

With his life in the hands of others, this ordinary person had no choice but to submit to Yu Aoqing's oppressive presence. Trembling, he stepped forward to take a look and spoke, "Esteemed ones, this is merely a small grass."

Hearing this, the five members of Yunxia Sect couldn't help but brighten up. Zhang Yu quickly asked, "What kind of grass?"

"It's snow-white and very beautiful," the man replied, then asked, "Should I pick it?"

"Don't touch it!" Yu Aoqing snapped. Only then did she lead the Yunxia disciples forward, with Yang Kai following closely behind. As they approached, the five members of Yunxia couldn't help but exclaim in admiration.

Indeed, it was a snow-white little grass, captivating like beautiful jade, appearing crystal clear with a faint glow of liquid flowing within its veins.

"Heavens!" Zhang Yu exclaimed, "It's Ice Muscle Jade Bone Grass!"

A smile also appeared on Yu Aoqing's face, "Indeed, it's a Heaven-Grade Upper-Level spirit herb!"

Luo Qianqian was equally excited, while Qi Yuan and Miao Lin remained relatively calm.

The reason for their excitement was that this Ice Muscle Jade Bone Grass was specifically used for women. It was similar to the Beauty's Heart that Yang Kai had obtained on the right half of Yunxia Peninsula. The Beauty's Heart, when consumed by women, could enhance their beauty slightly, while the Ice Muscle Jade Bone Grass could make a woman's skin crystal clear and tender, like that of a newborn.

If both were used together, they could transform an ugly woman into a beauty, yielding miraculous effects.

Women loved beauty, and with three women present, who wouldn't want to become more beautiful? Upon seeing the Ice Muscle Jade Bone Grass, they naturally felt delighted.

"To find such a treasure upon entering Hidden Island. It seems our trip will be a great success," Miao Lin said, his expression quite invigorated.

Yu Aoqing did not hesitate and directly bent down to pick the Ice Muscle Jade Bone Grass. Then, she took out a jade box from her bosom and carefully placed the grass inside.

Zhang Yu and Luo Qianqian watched wide-eyed, wanting to say something but hesitating.

Yu Aoqing smiled, "When we return to the sect, I'll have the alchemists refine it into a pill. There will definitely be a share for both of you, Junior Sisters."

She understood that it was not the right time to create any disputes among her peers, so she spoke to reassure them.

Sure enough, Zhang Yu and Luo Qianqian then smiled brightly, "Thank you, Senior Sister Qing. When it comes time to refine pills, we will need Senior Sister Qing to step in."

Having obtained a Heaven-Grade Upper-Level spirit herb, the previous worries and anxieties of the Yunxia group were swept away, and the heaviness and unease that lingered in their hearts gradually dissipated, replaced by a lighthearted and joyful mood.

It was as if they were not in dire straits but rather on a treasure hunt.

However, it must be said that Hidden Island had not been trodden upon for many years, and indeed, many rare treasures had grown here. The group had walked for two days on Hidden Island and had already reaped a bountiful harvest, collecting over a dozen varieties of exotic flowers and herbs, all of which were at least Earth-Grade Middle-Level, and they even found a couple of Heaven-Grade herbs.

With such gains, the five members of Yunxia were even more motivated.

On this day, while they were walking, a hazy fog suddenly appeared ahead, obscuring everyone's vision.

The fog seemed strange, and the ordinary person leading the way halted, showing signs of hesitation and fear as he turned to look at Yu Aoqing.

"Keep moving!" Yu Aoqing remained unfazed, her beautiful face devoid of mercy.

The man had no choice but to move forward.

However, as soon as his body merged into the fog, a sudden rustling sound erupted. A heart-wrenching scream escaped his lips, short and urgent, and then he collapsed to the ground, convulsing uncontrollably.

The others turned pale, retreating in unison, fearfully observing the man's transformation.

It was as if he had been thrown into a boiling pot of oil. It seemed he was being melted by fierce flames, as white vapor continuously rose from his body. Flesh and blood separated from his bones, falling to the ground and turning into pools of dark red blood.

In just a few breaths, a living person had lost all flesh and blood, reduced to a pile of dry bones scattered on the ground.

An indescribable smell pervaded the air.

"Ugh..." Zhang Yu and Luo Qianqian turned pale, bending over to vomit aside, while Miao Lin and Qi Yuan were not much better off.

Yu Aoqing's long eyelashes trembled anxiously, her face and lips suddenly losing color, turning extremely pale. Although she was also horrified, she was not as undone as Zhang Yu and Luo Qianqian.

The ordinary person standing next to Yang Kai weakly fell to the ground.

Among them, the only one who remained somewhat calm was Yang Kai. Even so, he felt a chill rising from his feet.

If he had entered just now, he would have likely met the same fate.

However, if Yu Aoqing had truly forced him in, Yang Kai would not have taken the risk.

"This fog contains deadly poison!" Yu Aoqing turned stiffly, casting a faint glance at everyone, feigning calmness as she said, "We should bypass it!"

Having just witnessed such a terrifying scene, the others were eager to leave, quickly following Yu Aoqing's lead.

After walking several miles, they finally regained their composure.

Having survived a calamity, the Yunxia disciples looked at Yu Aoqing with gratitude. If it weren't for her caution, one of them might have perished in that fog, and that person could have been any one of them.

After this incident, they admired Yu Aoqing's earlier decision to bring an ordinary person to scout even more.

Yang Kai also knew it was time for him to find an opportunity to leave. Otherwise, if he encountered another deadly situation like just now, he would surely be pushed out by Yu Aoqing to test the waters. Staying with this group would eventually lead to his demise at the hands of that venomous woman.

Now he just needed an opportunity—one that would leave them flustered and unable to pay attention to him!

While the group was resting, a sudden rustling sound reached their ears. Yang Kai frowned, sensing something was amiss.

"What sound is that?" Miao Lin stood up abruptly, alarmed.

"Is there a sound?" Qi Yuan tilted his head to listen.

"Shh, everyone be quiet and listen carefully!" Yu Aoqing clearly heard something too.

Everyone held their breath, listening as a buzzing noise came from all directions. It sounded like bees buzzing, but it was evidently much louder than the commotion made by bees.

The buzzing sound quickly approached, and beneath their feet, a rustling noise could also be heard. Looking closely, they saw countless thin lines converging towards their resting spot, as if something underground was rapidly digging towards them.

"Not good, run!" Yu Aoqing's expression changed drastically as she shouted. She hurriedly ran in one direction.

The Yunxia disciples quickly followed. Although Yang Kai wanted to find an opportunity to escape, he did not want to expose himself too early. Moreover, he still had not figured out what kind of enemy they were, so he naturally wanted to use the Yunxia disciples to gather information first.

Everyone moved quickly. After Yu Aoqing gave the order, they dashed out. But after just a few steps, a scream suddenly came from behind.

They turned back, their souls nearly fleeing their bodies.

The ordinary person who had fallen behind was now surrounded by a group of bizarre black insects, roughly the size of a bowl. As he screamed in horror, his clothes were torn apart, and blood and flesh flew everywhere. In just a moment, he collapsed to the ground, lifeless.

The eyes of the others trembled violently. Although they were martial artists, they did not recognize these ferocious insects. The unknown terror left them at a loss.

Witnessing the power of these insects, the five members of Yunxia ran even faster, and at this moment, no one paid attention to Yang Kai. They had no time to care about him; their lives were at stake.

Not long after, Yu Aoqing suddenly stopped, and the others hurriedly asked, "What's wrong?"

"There are more ahead! We are surrounded!" Yu Aoqing's face turned pale.

Everyone looked ahead and indeed saw a buzzing sound filling the air, a swarm of black insects flying toward them.

"Break through!" Yu Aoqing decisively commanded.

The Yunxia members quickly drew their weapons and charged into the swarm.

These insects were numerous, but they seemed to be of low rank. The five members of Yunxia formed a defensive formation, and after a flurry of attacks, they managed to kill many insects, causing them to fall to the ground in droves.

This sight gave them a glimmer of hope, and they fought even harder.

Yang Kai followed closely behind them. Perhaps it was because the Yunxia members' attacks attracted the attention of these insects, but he remained unharmed and was not targeted by the swarm.

"What are these things?" Yang Kai asked as he cautiously advanced.

"I've never seen them," the Earth Demon replied.

"You haven't seen them either?" Yang Kai was speechless.

The Earth Demon helplessly said, "Please forgive me for being ignorant after living so long..."

This old demon still had the mood to joke in such a life-and-death situation!

At that moment, Yang Kai suddenly saw Qi Yuan reaching out to him, grabbing his collar and tossing him outward.

It turned out that too many insects had surged from the side, and he was momentarily unable to cope, wanting to use Yang Kai as a shield.

Yang Kai's expression turned cold. He knew he could no longer hide. With a flick of his hands, he grabbed Qi Yuan's arm, and as he was forcefully thrown, Yang Kai flipped over, dissipating the force and landing on the ground. He twisted his body and sent Qi Yuan flying into the swarm of insects.

"Ah..." Qi Yuan was stunned, not understanding how he had been thrown out. The next moment, he was engulfed by the swarm, and a shrill scream escaped him.

"Qi Yuan!" Zhang Yu shouted in terror, then glared coldly at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai sneered, and his True Yang Primordial Qi erupted suddenly, enveloping him in a brilliant red light, like a burning fireball.

The four members of Yunxia were stunned by this sudden turn of events, completely unprepared for the ordinary person they had been with for several days to undergo such a transformation.

Ignoring the Yunxia members, Yang Kai directly charged toward the direction Qi Yuan had been thrown.

The swarm quickly surrounded him, but in the face of the scorching True Yang Primordial Qi, these winged little creatures were utterly powerless, falling like dumplings, unable to fly before even getting close to Yang Kai.

The four members of Yunxia watched in shock as Yang Kai, wrapped in blazing primordial energy, carved out a path and elegantly made his escape.

"He..." Miao Lin was left speechless in shock.

"Don't get distracted! Follow me out!" Yu Aoqing glared hatefully at Yang Kai's back, her silver teeth nearly grinding to dust.

It turned out this person was not an ordinary person but a hidden martial artist!
