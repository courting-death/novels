## Chapter 314 — Treasure Vault

"Treasure Vault?" Yang Kai felt a stir in his heart, secretly cursing that Enchantress Queen for trying to lure him with promises of wealth.

While murmuring about not being swayed by riches, he asked aloud, "Is there anything good in that Treasure Vault?"

"Of course!" Bilo shot him a glare, "Naturally, there are many good things in the master's Treasure Vault. The master said your strength is too low; entering her Treasure Vault allows you to find some items for cultivation to enhance your abilities!"

"Then what are we waiting for?" Yang Kai urged.

Seeing his eager demeanor, Bilo could not help but ridicule him in her heart, secretly cursing the unsophisticated country bumpkin.

Though reluctant, she would never question anything that Shan Qingluo commanded.

"Follow me," she said impatiently and led the way.

After a long walk through the palace, they suddenly arrived at a secluded room. Upon entering, they walked no more than ten zhang before encountering a heavy door.

This door was made of an unknown material, looking rather aged and extraordinarily heavy, clearly not something that could be easily broken through.

What was even stranger was that there was no handle on the door, nor any visible seams; it looked as if it was a solid part of the walls.

Bilo pulled out a black rectangular object from her waist, and with her delicate hands, quickly formed a seal and infused it with True Essence.

Moments later, she pressed the rectangular object against the door.

With a thunderous boom, the heavy door swung open.

Yang Kai looked around curiously and could not help but praise, "This place is indeed very secure for hiding things."

Bilo snorted lightly, proudly declaring, "Of course! The entire Treasure Vault is forged from Scarlet Whistle Black Gold. Even a peak master of the Divine Roaming Realm would find it impossible to open this Treasure Vault for quite some time; it's truly one of the safest places in the world."

Listening to her grandstanding, Yang Kai did not bother to refute her, merely suppressing a smirk.

If we talk about security, his Black Book space was undoubtedly the safest of all.

"Come in!" Bilo stepped inside first and waved him over.

Once both had entered, the Treasure Vault door closed behind them again.

Though this Treasure Vault was sealed, it was not at all dim. The walls were adorned with pebbles the size of eggs, glowing softly and illuminating the entire space brilliantly.

Upon entering, Bilo expressionlessly introduced to Yang Kai, "Over there are gold and silver treasures, here are herbs, this area is for Pills, and here are secret treasures and weapons. This is for cultivation techniques… um, just look for yourself. Don’t bother me with trivial matters!"

She seemed eager to send Yang Kai away.

Yang Kai pinched his nose, frowning, "Miss Bilo, did your master mention how much I can take from here?"

Bilo scoffed, disdainfully replying, "How much do you want to take?"

"I’m just asking!" 

Bilo maintained a sullen expression, impatiently saying, "The master said you can take as much as you want!"

"Oh." Hearing this, Yang Kai relaxed his guard and directly walked over to the pile of herbs to start searching.

Seeing his utter lack of manners, Bilo could not help but mutter, "Hmph, he really is a country bumpkin; I can’t understand why the master is so nice to him!"

As she said this, she quickly moved over to the section of secret treasures. Familiar with the layout, she took out a pair of exquisitely designed earrings that were an ethereal blue, looking crystal clear and resembling two teardrops.

Holding the earrings in her palm, Bilo's face broke into a radiant smile, unwilling to let go.

Yang Kai stood aside with a cold laugh.

The Enchantress Queen had imprisoned him in the palace, although she meant no harm, it still left a sour taste in his heart. However, allowing Yang Kai access to the Treasure Vault was clearly her oversight.

If Yang Kai wished to, he could empty the entire Treasure Vault without trouble; his Black Book space was far larger than this treasure store.

However, Yang Kai did not want to reveal the secret of his Black Book space, so he could only search for some useful items here.

His Yang Liquid in the Dantian needed replenishing. The energy within his Proud Bone Golden Body was abundant and he didn’t have to worry about running dry, but his Yang Liquid was steadily depleting.

He didn’t let any herb or Pill with a Yang attribute slip by; all were collected into the Black Book space.

Also, nourishing herbs and Pills for the soul were scarce, but he could not miss those either.

The Warm Spirit Lotus needed these for evolution, and his Divine Sense required such herbs to expand, so he gathered everything into the Black Book space.

As for cultivation techniques and martial skills, he was less concerned; he didn’t need any cultivation methods, and the martial skills here probably wouldn’t contain anything extraordinary.

Yang Kai was more interested in finding a high-quality soul technique to cultivate.

Although his Divine Sense had been tempered long ago, due to a lack of soul techniques, he had yet to utilize it effectively, only using it to scout the surroundings.

But inside this Treasure Vault, after searching for a while, he couldn’t find anything decent. A few soul techniques he came across were all below Earth-Grade; such techniques were frankly beneath his notice. Even if he practiced them, they would be of little use and merely waste his time.

After a thorough search, he found only some Yang attribute herbs and Pills, along with a few items to nourish his Divine Sense.

Taking two bottles of Heaven-Grade Pills as a symbolic gesture, Yang Kai finally searched for Bilo.

This alluring young lady had now adorned herself with the earrings, checking herself in a mirror and giggling incessantly.

Yang Kai suddenly appeared before her, startling her; she patted her soft chest with her small hand, frowning as she took a breath, annoyedly saying, "How come you make no sound when you walk?"

Yang Kai was taken aback, "Were you too immersed in your own world?"

Bilo's face reddened, and she hurriedly took off the earrings from her earlobe, carefully putting them away and reluctantly pulling her gaze away. "Have you found what you need?"

"Yes."

"What did you find?"

Yang Kai raised the two bottles of Pills in his hand. Bilo was slightly surprised, chuckling lightly, "I didn’t expect you to have such good taste; I thought you’d definitely want to…"

She trailed off, pursing her lips and leaving her words unspoken.

"Definitely what?"

"Nothing. Once you’re done, let’s go. But are you sure you only want these two bottles of Pills? The master told you to find some items to enhance your strength," Bilo asked doubtfully, "Can you really enhance your strength with just these?"

"Enough!" Yang Kai nodded.

"I won’t care about you anymore; let me make it clear, it's not that I didn’t give you options. You’re the one who only wants these two bottles of Pills. If the master asks later, don’t blame me." 

Yang Kai replied indifferently, "Okay."

After exiting the Treasure Vault, Bilo closed the heavy door once again. Just as she turned around, a box flew towards them.

Bilo was startled, catching it and warily eyeing Yang Kai.

Upon realizing what kind of box she had caught, she exclaimed in surprise, looking at Yang Kai with a shocked expression.

Yang Kai smiled faintly, "You like this, don’t you?"

"Of course I do!" Bilo nodded repeatedly, filled with joy as she opened the box. Inside lay the very earrings she had just tried on and returned.

"How did you know?" Bilo gazed at Yang Kai in surprise.

"I could tell from your expression," Yang Kai chuckled lightly, "I'm not blind."

"Hehe…" Bilo could not suppress her joy, hastily taking out the earrings, gazing at them dreamily, saying, "This is only a pair of Lower-Level secret treasures, but I fell in love with them the first time I saw them."

"Why didn’t you ask your master for them? I see your master is quite good to you," Yang Kai inquired suspiciously.

"Um… these belonged to the previous master before she passed. I feared she’d be sad if she saw them…" Bilo sighed softly, suddenly cradling the earrings in her arms like a treasure, "Is this for me?"

"Yes, otherwise why would I take them out? If your master asks, just say I took them." 

"Thank you!" Bilo looked at him with a complex expression, suddenly eyeing him suspiciously, "Why are you being so nice to me? Do you have ulterior motives? Are you interested in me?"

Yang Kai laughed wryly, "You’re thinking too much."

"I'll tell you, I don’t like men," Bilo warned, staring at Yang Kai, seemingly trying to discern the truth in his words, "So no matter how you flatter me, I won't fall for you! In my heart, the master is the perfect partner!"

Yang Kai was dumbfounded, staring at her in shock, muttering, "You mean you like… Shan Qingluo?"

"Exactly!" Bilo's cheeks flushed, yet she stubbornly nodded, brimming with shy anticipation, "One day, I will become the master’s wife…"

At that moment, she displayed the pure emotional longing that a young girl should have; it was just that the object of her affection seemed a bit problematic.

Yang Kai took a deep breath, nodding mechanically. After a while, he managed to say, "Then I wish Miss Bilo your dreams come true and your endeavors meet success!"

Bilo giggled, tilting her head to size Yang Kai up, satisfied, she said, "I've just realized that you’re not as unpleasant as I thought!"

It seemed that giving her a gift had yielded good results, as she no longer treated him with the coldness she had before.

"Hehe…" Yang Kai laughed awkwardly, unsure of what else to say.

Bilo then said, "Alright, we've finished looking around the Treasure Vault. The master said if you find it boring, I can take you to walk around the city. Do you want to go outside?"

"No, I want to go back and cultivate," Yang Kai replied.

"Hmph…" Bilo chuckled meaningfully, "That makes sense; there’s nothing too interesting outside with Yunli and Ruoyu Ruoqing in Fenghuan Tower."

"Also, if you ever… cough cough… when you do something, be sure to target sister Yunli first; she hasn’t been with a man since her husband died just a month after they married—it's almost been ten years. She must be like a hungry wolf now… You have to take care of yourself. By the way, sister Yun likes it when you touch her ears…" Bilo blushed as she advised Yang Kai, her lovely face glowing with a springtime allure.

Yang Kai’s face turned a deep shade of gray.

How could such a charming young girl be so brazen in discussing such matters? Moreover, she seemed to have some experience; he truly had no idea where she had gained such knowledge.
