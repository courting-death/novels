## Chapter 296 — Bewitching Woman

As she spoke, she retracted the ancient shield into her body and quickly formed seals with her hands. Waves of energy with different attributes suddenly surged from within her.

The four great attributes of wind, cloud, thunder, and lightning converged around her, forming a terrifying force.

She gazed deeply at Yang Kai, her beautiful eyes filled with an arrogant defiance.

"I don't have time to play with you!" Yang Kai shouted angrily, slashing out a sword light, taking to the air to leave this place.

However, delayed by Qiu Yimeng, a nearby Divine Roaming Realm expert had already arrived. Before the person even appeared, an attack had already been launched from afar.

Yang Kai cursed inwardly, dodging while swiftly executing the first half of Ten Thousand Swords Return to One.

With a light ringing sound, countless sword energies suddenly surrounded his body. As he wielded the Shura Sword, half of these sword energies protected him while the other half shot forward, trying to create an opening.

"Stay here!" A voice came from the side, carrying an air of superiority. "Dare to disrespect the young lady? You seek death!"

A violent attack came, shattering all the sword energies, and not only that, Yang Kai's momentum was slightly halted.

A figure flashed ahead, blocking his path was a Sixth Stage Divine Roaming Realm expert, gazing coldly at Yang Kai.

"Let's see if you have the ability!" Yang Kai remained unafraid, sneering as countless sword energies reappeared around him, overwhelming the area as they surged towards the opponent. At the same time, a flurry of blood-red petals suddenly flew out from his body, each one a sharp killing weapon.

Thousand-Petal Blood Sea Begonia!

Since refining this treasure from the Falling Flower Sect, Yang Kai had not used it until this moment. He finally had to bring out all his abilities.

A thousand blood-red petals surrounded him, his thoughts directed them like extensions of his own body, transforming into a sea of red light as they surged towards the Sixth Stage Divine Roaming Realm expert.

"Heaven-Grade treasure!" The person, with keen eyesight, immediately recognized the extraordinary nature of the Thousand-Petal Blood Sea Begonia, causing a storm of shock in his heart. The full power of his Divine Roaming Realm cultivation erupted, and he thrust out both hands. A mountain-like phantom suddenly appeared before him, crashing down towards the Thousand-Petal Blood Sea Begonia.

With a loud crash, all the petals shattered and scattered. The mountain-like phantom also swayed in mid-air, suddenly dimming.

Seizing this opportunity, Yang Kai had already rushed in with his sword, striking down at the Sixth Stage Divine Roaming Realm expert, who had just executed an extremely energy-consuming martial skill and was still catching his breath. Upon sensing the malevolent aura from the Shura Sword, his expression changed drastically, and he hurriedly dodged.

However, Yang Kai merely feigned an attack, brushing past him and flying away.

"Where do you think you're going!" Qiu Yimeng's delicate voice rang out, laced with a hint of pride and coldness.

A massive pulling force suddenly came from behind, causing Yang Kai to involuntarily halt. He turned to see the destructive energy of wind, cloud, thunder, and lightning gathering around Qiu Yimeng, as if it had transformed into a muddy swamp, pulling at his body and making it impossible for him to break free.

"You shameless woman!" Yang Kai's expression changed drastically as he swung his sword, and the countless sword energies around him shot towards Qiu Yimeng.

Qiu Yimeng remained unfazed, a beautiful smile gracing her lips. The ancient shield reappeared before her, blocking Yang Kai's attack.

Yet, the thousand petals that had scattered outside were now silently encircling Qiu Yimeng.

"Sister Qiu, quickly dodge!" Luo Xiaoman called out while waving her hands, unleashing waves of mysterious light that transformed in mid-air into various weapons, clashing with the Thousand-Petal Blood Sea Begonia.

"You can't escape, surrender obediently!" Qiu Yimeng smiled sweetly, shouting as she fought with Yang Kai.

"Indeed, you little demon, you won't escape today!" Two figures flew in from the sides, two more Divine Roaming Realm experts had arrived.

Yang Kai's expression darkened to the extreme, a wave of faint powerlessness surged within him.

Facing a single Divine Roaming Realm expert, he had to unleash all his strength, using treasures and techniques, to have a slight chance of escape. Now that three had come, how could he resist?

Strength, it was still a matter of insufficient strength! The Third Stage True Yuan Realm was truly lacking!

The two Divine Roaming Realm experts who had just arrived were not polite at all. As they spoke, they suddenly unleashed their martial skills towards Yang Kai.

Yang Kai struggled to defend but still could not protect himself fully, feeling a crushing impact on his chest and shoulder, the sound of bones breaking echoing painfully as he fell like a broken kite.

Stumbling to his feet, he found himself surrounded on all sides by three Divine Roaming Realm experts, along with Qiu Yimeng and Luo Xiaoman, all of whom looked at him with unfriendly expressions.

As they gazed at the Shura Sword in his hand, even Qiu Yimeng could not help but feel a twinge of covetousness, while the others had greed written all over their faces.

And the Thousand-Petal Blood Sea Begonia fluttering around him was also a priceless treasure!

"Looks like you can't escape now, can you?" Qiu Yimeng mocked, watching Yang Kai as the three Divine Roaming Realm experts also wore unfriendly expressions, coldly snorting as they applied pressure.

"You little demon, self-destruct your cultivation, or I will take action myself!" One of the Divine Roaming Realm experts shouted coldly.

In this dire situation, Yang Kai sneered, his body filled with a chaotic demonic aura.

Although he was surrounded, there was still a chance to escape. Yang Kai contemplated that if he suddenly unleashed Unyielding Will and then used the Wings of Yang Flame, he might have a chance to flee.

The speed of the Wings of Yang Flame was much faster than that of ordinary Divine Roaming Realm experts. As long as he could withstand their first wave of attacks, he would be fine.

He had the Wan Yao Ling Milk, so even if he was injured, he could recover quickly.

The key was whether he could withstand their first wave of attacks, especially a combined assault. Yang Kai's brow furrowed.

"Why aren't you making a move!" The Divine Roaming Realm expert saw Yang Kai hesitating and became impatient, angrily shouting as he stepped forward.

Just as Yang Kai was determined to take a risk, the three Divine Roaming Realm experts suddenly changed their expressions, looking up at the sky as if facing a great enemy.

Yang Kai also furrowed his brow, sensing a powerful pressure coming from not far away, much denser than the pressure from the three Divine Roaming Realm experts before him.

"Misses, be careful!" The three of them no longer paid attention to Yang Kai, positioning themselves in front of Qiu Yimeng and Luo Xiaoman, their expressions grave.

Soon, a flash of bright red suddenly appeared, and everyone looked up to see a graceful figure standing in mid-air, only a dozen zhang away from them.

It was a woman, an exceedingly enchanting woman.

Dressed in tight-fitting fire-red clothing, her graceful figure was accentuated perfectly, her beauty striking, her posture alluring. Her arms, as delicate as jade, were exposed, adorned with silver bracelets on her smooth wrists. Her skin was snow-white, her legs long, and her waist curvy. She wore jade shoes, and her ten dainty toes playfully peeked out.

With phoenix-like brows and captivating eyes that seemed to hold countless charms, her delicate nose and fragrant lips added to her stunning beauty.

Her figure was slender, like a willow, and as the breeze brushed by, it seemed as if she could be easily broken.

A small beauty mark under her eye added to her allure.

She stood in mid-air, a faint blush on her cheeks, evoking endless fantasies.

Unlike Su Yan's icy beauty or Xia Ningshang's innocent charm, this woman was the kind that exuded seduction to the core. Even standing there, her demeanor was captivating and full of allure!

The men in the vicinity, regardless of age, couldn't help but swallow hard as their breaths grew heavy upon locking eyes with her.

Those enchanting eyes seemed to possess boundless magic, pulling at the souls of everyone present.

Even Qiu Yimeng and Luo Xiaoman felt their gazes slightly dazed, their faces flushed, their hearts racing uncontrollably.

Soon, Qiu Yimeng regained her composure, feeling a chill in her heart. She glanced around, gritting her teeth and muttering, "Men really are no good!"

The three Divine Roaming Realm experts blushed, awkwardly chuckling. Yet, they did not dare to be careless; a woman who could exert such pressure on them could not be weak.

The woman’s watery, phoenix-like eyes swept over the crowd, finally locking onto Yang Kai. Biting her red lips lightly, a hint of pained struggle flickered across her brow. After a moment of contemplation, she asked, "Which sect are you a disciple of?"

Her voice was sweet and soft, wrapping around the ears of everyone present like a gentle hand, caressing and teasing the hidden desires within their hearts.

The impulses that had just settled surged once more, and this time, even Qiu Yimeng and Luo Xiaoman were not exempt. Both women flushed deeply, unable to help but let out soft, enchanting moans from their throats.

"What?" Yang Kai frowned, perplexed.

He did not understand what this woman was asking.

"Eh..." A hint of surprise flashed in the woman's beautiful eyes, seemingly not expecting Yang Kai to recover so quickly. She realized that in her current state, silence was better, but once she spoke, everyone would be affected. How could this young man, filled with demonic energy, escape such instinctual desires?

Unbeknownst to her, Yang Kai had long been subjected to the influences of the Dual Cultivation Technique, making him more adept at suppressing his impulses than others.

"Forget it, I don't have time to explain." The struggle in the woman's brow intensified. She murmured to herself, not waiting for Yang Kai to react, and with a flick of her hand, a pink ribbon flew from her grasp, coiling around Yang Kai's waist like a serpent.

Yang Kai's expression changed, the Shura Sword in his hand just raised in preparation to counterattack when the woman had already appeared before him, parting her cherry-like lips to exhale a breath of fragrance towards him.

The scent, like orchids and musk, enveloped him, causing Yang Kai to feel his entire body go soft, utterly losing the strength to resist.

So powerful, this woman must have reached the peak of the Divine Roaming Realm! She looked young, how could she be so formidable?

"You've seen me, so you can't be left alive!" The woman sighed softly, her wrist flicking, sending the silver bracelet flying towards the Divine Roaming Realm expert opposite her.
