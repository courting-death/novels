## Chapter 322 — You Are Finished

“Let’s see how she performs in the future.” Seeing Yunli defend Bilo so much, Yang Kai refrained from saying anything further.

Moreover, he had no intention of bringing up the previous matter, his anger stemming solely from Bilo’s scheming against him, dragging him into unnecessary trouble.

After this incident, he believed Bilo wouldn’t dare to act so recklessly again.

Yunli continued, “The pills you purchased earlier are all placed in your bedroom, and the accounts have been settled.”

Yang Kai nodded lightly.

He mused on the benefits of having a powerful backing; being able to buy so many bottles of pills for restoring Divine Sense without any personal cost was indeed a stark contrast. No wonder the young heirs of those great powers cultivated much faster than ordinary people.

With such vast resources at their disposal, their achievements would always surpass others' from the same starting line due to their natural advantages.

This world has always been so unfair.

“There’s also something the Le Family sent over the day before yesterday.” The lovely woman smiled as she continued to report.

“Oh? The Le Family?” Yang Kai raised an eyebrow, surprised.

“Yes, they sent a bottle of Mystery-Grade pills, also for restoring Divine Sense,” Yunli said, gazing at Yang Kai with a delicate smile. “I heard the Le Family dispatched it overnight from a family more than a hundred miles away, instructing the maid to ensure you receive it. Seeing you were healing, I took the liberty of holding onto it. Do you think… we should return it?”

“Not returning it!” Yang Kai chuckled, “Why should we return something that was sent to us? Naturally, we should accept it.”

It seemed Yunli anticipated his response, and she nodded slightly, “That’s true. If we return it, it would likely embarrass the Le Family. It would turn a major issue into a minor one and dissipate potential animosity. Truly, Young Master is magnanimous.”

Flattery...

Yang Kai felt a bit embarrassed.

As for why the Le Family would send such a precious thing, Yang Kai understood—it was merely an attempt to smooth over the previous incident. However, the Le Family was, after all, a major power, and he found it quite unexpected for them to be so accommodating.

“Shan Qingluo’s influence seems quite substantial.” Yang Kai mumbled to himself, thinking that it was likely the Le Family was being so amiable out of regard for Shan Qingluo.

Little did he know, the Le Family simply couldn’t fathom his background and wished to avoid offending him.

If they could dispose of Yang Kai quietly, would the Le Family be so generous? The fact was that the battle between Yang Kai and Le Yu occurred in Piaoxiang City, witnessed by many. For the time being, they dared not offend him and could only swallow their pride.

Though a bottle of Mystery-Grade pills was valuable, it was still affordable for the Le Family.

The lovely woman Yunli smiled slightly at his words and continued, “There’s one more matter that needs to be reported to you.”

“What matter?” 

“Many young masters and misses from major forces within the city want to extend an invitation to you, hoping to socialize with you…”

Yang Kai’s mysterious background was too notable; it was difficult to avoid attracting attention. In recent days, major forces in Piaoxiang City had been probing into Yang Kai’s origins, but despite their investigations, they had not managed to uncover anything—neither his background nor even his name.

They had only just begun inviting Yang Kai as a means to gather intelligence.

If his background was truly impressive, they wished to forge a connection; if not, it was fine too. Any power would be willing to extend an olive branch to a young man with such potential.

“I’m not going,” Yang Kai frowned, “I have nothing to discuss with them.”

Seeing his resolute refusal, the lovely woman was taken aback for a moment, then smiled graciously, “That works too.”

“I’m going to cultivate,” Yang Kai informed her before striding directly upstairs.

Watching his disappearing figure, Yunli’s expression became peculiar as she shook her head in wry amusement. She had never seen someone so passionate about their cultivation.

Looking at him, it was apparent that his strength was not without reason.

In the following days, Yang Kai delved into the mysteries of the True Alchemy Formula, but progress was slow, and he had no idea how long it would take to grasp its entirety.

However, Yang Kai didn’t care much; he merely used the opportunity to enhance his Divine Sense through the exploration of the True Alchemy Formula. Attaining the knowledge within was secondary.

With each bottle of pills consumed, his Divine Sense indeed grew significantly—becoming not only resilient and powerful but also covering a much larger area than before.

The pills were dwindling fast due to their low quality; the effects were not ideal. Yang Kai wanted to rapidly restore his Divine Sense, needing to compensate with quantity.

Only the last bottle of Mystery-Grade pills from the Le Family lasted less than two days before being completely depleted.

No one dared to cultivate their Divine Sense like Yang Kai, recklessly exhausting their Divine Sense powers and then devouring pills to replenish them. Others would have already run into problems, be it chaotic Divine Sense or becoming foolish, much less surviving.

But due to the effect of the Warm Spirit Lotus, Yang Kai had no such worries.

Ten days later.

With the pills exhausted, Yang Kai felt his Divine Sense had grown considerably. He attempted to disrupt the Soul Pursuit Seal left on him by Shan Qingluo, but unfortunately, he was still unable to shake it, inadvertently provoking a strand of her Divine Thought left within the Soul Pursuit Seal, which began to allure and entice him with overwhelming charm.

One day, he would strip her bare and mercilessly punish her! Yang Kai swore in his heart.

A gentle knock resounded outside.

“Come in!” Yang Kai called out in a deep voice.

The door opened to reveal Bilo, dressed in fiery red clothing, her delicate face striking and sexy as she walked in with a giggle.

It was evident that she had intentionally dressed up, and her attire seemed to mimic Shan Qingluo's style, with a hint of allure in her demeanor.

Yang Kai was slightly taken aback, “What brings you here?”

Since returning to the palace that day, Bilo had not appeared before Yang Kai, while the lovely woman Yunli often spoke well of her, urging Yang Kai not to pursue matters from before.

He hadn’t anticipated that today she would proactively come to find him.

However, the current Bilo no longer exhibited the arrogance and domineering nature she once had. Facing Yang Kai, she could not help but feel a tad nervous and constrained.

“I came to see you.” Bilo’s voice was soft and rare warmth radiated from her, as she timidly sized up Yang Kai.

Yang Kai chuckled lightly, “If you’re still concerned about that matter, you need not worry; I won’t trouble you.”

“You’re not angry?” Bilo gazed at him in surprise.

“As long as you don’t scheme against me again!”

“Of course! I promise I won’t do that again; that day was just an accident.” Bilo giggled, standing in front of Yang Kai playfully and whispered, “If the master asks about that day…”

“Just a moment of impulse; I sparred with Le Yu,” Yang Kai replied, recognizing the need for an answer.

Bilo chuckled, her delicate hand tapping her soft chest while taking a deep breath, entirely laying down the weight in her heart. Sincerely, she said, “You’re really quite nice; I misjudged you before!”

Just as she finished her compliment, she noticed Yang Kai's fiery gaze focused on her chest. She quickly covered herself with her arms, blushing as she exclaimed, “Hey, don’t look around!”

After speaking, as if recalling something, she loosened her arms and proudly pushed her ample bosom forward, nonchalantly saying, “Look, just treat it as an apology; it won’t drop a piece of flesh.”

Her boldness somewhat overwhelmed Yang Kai.

Bilo then let out a playful laugh, leaping onto the soft bed and coming around to Yang Kai’s back. Kneeling partly, she reached out with both hands to adjust Yang Kai's head, her fingers gently kneading.

“What are you doing…” Yang Kai was astonished.

“Isn’t it Yunli who comes to help you relax at this time every day? I’ve taken over her job today. I wanted to apologize, but didn’t expect you to be so easy-going. Rarely do I get to serve you, so just enjoy it with gratitude,” Bilo replied.

Yang Kai could only stare in surprise, realizing how remorseful Bilo truly was regarding the events from that day.

Otherwise, she wouldn’t go out of her way to please him.

Ever since that day when Yunli had helped Yang Kai relieve his fatigue, he had come to greatly enjoy it every day.

The exhaustion from cultivating his Divine Sense was always alleviated by those slender and delicate fingers, making one feel as though they were floating on a cloud—giddily comfortable.

Bilo must have figured this out beforehand to know how to treat him.

Her technique wasn’t as refined as Yunli’s but was done with earnestness.

After a considerable time, Bilo suddenly asked, “Is it comfortable?”

“It's alright,” Yang Kai replied honestly.

“Just alright?” Bilo pouted, feeling somewhat defeated, and her eyes darted, plotting mischievous thoughts.

Suddenly, a soft moan resonated in Yang Kai’s ear, imbued with endless charm and temptation. Soon after, waves of decadent and alluring moans echoed around, causing Yang Kai to open his eyes abruptly, only to see young maidens dressed provocatively, their garments half-unraveled, their bodies intermingling like water snakes coming towards him.

In an instant, Yang Kai’s breaths grew heavy, a wildfire igniting within him.

Sensing something amiss, he quickly activated the Dual Cultivation Technique, while Bilo behind him let out a soft exhale, suddenly becoming limply weak, her enchanting eyes momentarily lost in haziness.

The Yin Yang Dual Cultivation Technique seemed capable of countering any alluring arts; the last time Yang Kai fell under the influence of Shan Qingluo's aura, it was also due to utilizing this technique to escape the illusion.

This time proved successful as well, dispelling the illusions.

“What are you doing?” Yang Kai turned around to find Bilo’s cheeks flushed, her eyes shimmering with mist, evidently affected by the recoil of her own alluring arts.

Fortunately, she had just begun her endeavors, and since she bore no hostility towards Yang Kai, the backlash was minimal, merely affecting her spirit without injuring her.

“I was trying to make you comfortable…” Bilo’s breath became uneven, her form entirely drained as she stared at Yang Kai in shock. “What did you do? Why did I recoil?”

“You cultivate alluring arts?” Yang Kai couldn’t help but roll his eyes at her, astonished that her method was the same as Shan Qingluo’s.

“Hmm…” Bilo responded softly, her seductive appearance and moans teasing Yang Kai’s heart.

This was a far more effective temptation than the alluring arts.

Yang Kai grinned menacingly, “You’re done for. I just told you not to scheme against me, and here you are doing exactly that. It looks like you haven’t learned your lesson!”
