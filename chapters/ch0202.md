## Chapter 202 — Worshipping the Madam

In a moment of desperation, Miao Huacheng had no choice but to bring up Yunxia Sect, hoping that Yang Kai would be wary and cease his actions, allowing him to perhaps retain his life.

However, it was evident that the other party did not regard Yunxia Sect at all. In the blink of an eye, he appeared before Miao Huacheng, seemingly delivering a casual palm strike to his chest, which sent him lightly retreating. His eyes were filled with cold ruthlessness.

It felt as if Miao Huacheng's heart was gripped by a scalding hand, violently contracting before suddenly expanding fiercely.

With a loud retch, Miao Huacheng spat out blood incessantly, his skin turning bright red as if scalded by boiling water. Although he was not dead, he was severely injured.

Taking advantage of his moment of weakness, the Earth Demon struck ruthlessly, driving the Soul-Breaking Spike into Miao Huacheng's body, delivering a fatal blow.

Who exactly was this person? Why did he come to the Miao family to unleash such slaughter?

As Miao Huacheng faced death, he was consumed by thoughts of where he had offended this young man, yet he could not grasp the answer. It must be said, being killed so confusedly left him with a lingering sense of regret.

Above Haicheng, the winds and clouds gathered ominously, and immense heavenly energy surged wildly around Yang Kai.

Having broken through a major realm, he was now able to undergo the baptism of heavenly energy.

Yang Kai executed his movement technique and swiftly left the Miao family, soon arriving at the seaside.

That night, the wind howled and the waves crashed. Countless martial artists in Haicheng looked towards the sea in terror, knowing that it was the result of a person’s breakthrough, creating a phenomenon of heaven and earth. Yet, the magnitude of this terrifying spectacle made them too afraid to approach, merely gazing from afar with expressions of reverence and envy.

This person must be a master! It was highly likely that he had broken through from the True Yuan Realm to the Divine Roaming Realm; otherwise, how could such a commotion occur? The overall strength of the martial artists in Haicheng was not high, naturally making them hesitant to provoke a master of the Divine Roaming Realm.

But no one could have imagined that this phenomenon was merely the result of a fifteen-year-old boy breaking through from the Qi Movement Realm to the Separation and Union Realm. If they had known, they would surely have dropped their jaws in shock.

The chaotic commotion lasted for half the night before gradually subsiding. After the storm, some vaguely saw a ball of fire flying out from the seaside, heading towards the depths of the ocean.

Through that firelight, one could vaguely see something resembling wings. However, even if someone saw it, they would not dare to believe their eyes, thinking it was merely an illusion.

At dawn, on Yunxia Island.

Yang Kai arrived at the right peninsula, standing on the peak where he had parted ways with Madam Jiang, gazing out.

The entire Yunxia was now in a state of desolation, even on the right peninsula. One could almost smell the stench of blood in the air. Everywhere he looked, there were corpses strewn about, remnants of the great battle, and pools of dark red blood that had yet to dry. Houses lay in ruins, walls crumbled.

Birds flew overhead, and the earth groaned.

The Yunxia family had been slaughtered!

Before Yang Kai lay a skeleton, dressed in a tattered blue and white dress, the very one Madam Jiang had worn that day.

The skeleton sat quietly on the peak, like an immortal rock.

Yang Kai could almost clearly see that after he had parted ways with Madam Jiang, she had remained seated here, her gaze directed towards the direction of the Miao family in Haicheng.

A gentle breeze blew, stirring Madam Jiang's hair. Her eyes were dull, like a sky shrouded in dark clouds, devoid of light, devoid of hope.

She watched like this, never closing her eyes until the end of her life.

Until last night, she had witnessed the destruction of the Miao family, seen Miao Huacheng die at Yang Kai's hands.

Heaven's way is just; who can escape the cycle of retribution?

The grievances have been resolved! Evil people will eventually receive their just deserts.

Yang Kai took out a flask of wine and offered a tribute before Madam Jiang, extending his hand to bury her remains. However, as soon as his hand touched the skeleton, it suddenly crumbled, falling to the ground and turning into a pile of powder.

A fierce wind rose from the ground, scattering the powder, which drifted across the right peninsula of Yunxia and fell into the sea, vanishing without a trace.

Yang Kai's eyes narrowed slightly, his expression tinged with sorrow and desolation.

That day, he had wanted to take Madam Jiang away. But she had refused, her heart already dead; living would only bring her torment and a lifetime of misery. Following her deceased husband and daughter was her best destination.

Yang Kai had respected her wishes, and now, looking back, he wondered if his actions that day were correct.

Sensing the desolation in Yang Kai's heart, the Earth Demon hesitated for a moment before speaking to comfort him, "Young Master, you are not this Madam; how can you know that death was not a form of liberation for her?"

Yang Kai remained silent, and after a long while, he turned and spread his Wings of Yang Flame, flying towards the sea.

Perhaps, for her, it was a form of liberation, but for himself, there was a hint of regret.

In the following two days, Yang Kai took out many rare flowers and herbs he had collected from Hidden Island, trading them for yang-attribute items in Haicheng, refining them into Yang Liquid to store in his Dantian.

On the night of the second day, Yang Kai carried two large bundles and flew northward.

Not long after Yang Kai left Haicheng, major islands and forces overseas received shocking yet exhilarating news.

Tai Yi Sect: "What? Gu Yun Island has recovered the Transforming Moonbreaker Technique? Is this news true?"

Shura Sect: "What? Gu Yun Island has recovered the Transforming Moonbreaker Technique? What about the Shura Sword, our sect's treasure?"

Falling Flower Sect: "The Transforming Moonbreaker Technique has been found? What about the Thousand Petal Blood Begonia? That is the foundation of our sect, lost together with the Transforming Moonbreaker Technique back then!"

Chilian Sect: "Go to Gu Yun Island and investigate the whereabouts of our sect leader's token."

Yunlong Island: …

Upon hearing that Gu Yun Island's supreme technique had been recovered, more than a dozen major forces could no longer remain calm. They had all lost their items together; it was unreasonable for Gu Yun Island to have found theirs while theirs remained missing. In an instant, the winds rose, and masters from various islands set out together.

Gu Yun Island was overwhelmed within a day, filled with experts from overseas major forces, leaving Gu Feng and the elders of Gu Yun Island utterly exhausted from entertaining them.

After detailing the recovery of the Transforming Moonbreaker Technique, these dozen forces hurriedly made their way to Yunxia Sect.

Poor Yunxia, merely a third-rate force, had been exterminated due to a single Transforming Moonbreaker Technique. Yet, these dozen forces went on to scour Yunxia Island repeatedly, hoping to recover their sect's lost items from three hundred years ago.

But those items had long been taken away by Yang Kai; how could they find them? Unable to find anything, they naturally became furious, and anger led to violence. With no one to strike, they turned to attack the island.

In less than three days, the entire Yunxia Island vanished from the world's sight, completely shattered.

Yang Kai, of course, was unaware of the calamity that befell Yunxia after his departure. At this moment, he was already nearing Lingxiao Pavilion.

Having accumulated a significant amount of Yang Liquid in Haicheng, he was able to fly back to the sect swiftly.

Choosing a night, Yang Kai descended just fifty li from Lingxiao Pavilion, unfolding his movement technique to continue forward.

An hour later, gazing at the Lingxiao Pavilion he had not seen for nearly half a year, Yang Kai smiled faintly, feeling his mood, which had been somewhat heavy due to the matter of Madam Jiang, finally lighten.

He felt no sense of belonging to the sect, but he knew that here, there was a woman who could accompany him for a lifetime, waiting for him.

Carrying two large bundles, he stealthily entered the sect. Just as he stepped inside, Yang Kai's brows furrowed.

"Young Master..." the Earth Demon called out quietly.

"Ignore it!" Yang Kai's eyes narrowed; he had just sensed several Divine Senses sweep over him.

In the past, Yang Kai would not have been able to detect these, as those who could probe him with Divine Sense were at least in the Divine Roaming Realm, several major realms above him.

However, ever since he acquired the Warm Spirit Lotus, Yang Kai's senses had become exceptionally sharp. He had already sensed these Divine Senses sweeping over him.

They were unfamiliar Divine Senses, definitely not from the elders of Lingxiao Pavilion.

Fortunately, these Divine Senses merely probed and bore no malice; they swept past and did not focus on Yang Kai again. But this discovery made his heart skip a beat.

Why had so many experts suddenly appeared in Lingxiao Pavilion? He felt a vague sense of foreboding and sighed; it seemed that the sect was not at peace.

Almost at the moment Yang Kai returned to Lingxiao Pavilion, a small pavilion within was occupied by Su Yan, who was in closed-door cultivation, suddenly opened her eyes wide.

"Is he back?" Su Yan murmured softly, her red lips pursed slightly, a blush involuntarily rising on her face. In her heart, it felt as if a voice was calling her, urging her to move closer to that person. This call stirred her heart, making her somewhat flustered and unable to calm herself to meditate.

What a nemesis! During his absence, though there were times when she found it difficult to endure, the operation of the Ice Heart Technique allowed her to calm her emotions, and through this trial and resistance, her mindset had rapidly improved.

But upon learning of his return, her Ice Heart Technique seemed to lose all effectiveness, and she could not even maintain her composure.

After a moment's thought, Su Yan decided not to persist. She stood up, pushed open the door, and enveloped in a chill and ethereal aura, her figure transformed into a pure white shadow, swiftly approaching Dragon Confinement Ravine.

By the side of Dragon Confinement Ravine, Yang Kai turned back to glance, a faint smile appearing on his lips.

"Earth Demon, go play by yourself," Yang Kai casually tossed the Earth Demon and the Soul-Breaking Spike away.

"Hey... cough cough..." The Earth Demon was speechless, thinking to himself that he was not a three-year-old child; why was the Young Master dismissing him like this?

However, the evil energy beneath Dragon Confinement Ravine had a strong attraction for the Earth Demon, and he did not hesitate, diving down directly.

After standing by the edge of Dragon Confinement Ravine for a moment, a pure white figure quickly approached, stopping about three zhang away from Yang Kai.

Their eyes met, both filled with affection.

Yang Kai's eyes brimmed with longing, while Su Yan’s moist eyes were filled with tenderness.

Silently, they gazed at each other, taking in the changes they had undergone over the past few months.

He had grown much stronger and a bit more robust, yet there was a hint of unshakeable weariness and sorrow in his eyes. This sense of having weathered many storms should not have appeared in someone of his age, yet it added a touch of maturity and steadiness to him. Seeing this faint weariness, Su Yan's heart ached slightly.

She knew that in these months away, Yang Kai must have encountered many things.
