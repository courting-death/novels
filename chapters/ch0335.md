## Chapter 335 — What a Set-Up

The two sisters had been hiding in the Cangyun Evil Land for days, without a moment's rest. Constantly pursued by the people of the Xiaoyao Sect, they had been embroiled in continuous battles. If it weren't for the rapid recovery speed of their True Essence with the help of the Consonant Spirit Technique, they would likely have been captured long ago.

After entering the Bloodthirsty Evil Cave, the two had to contend with the evil spirits, leaving them utterly exhausted. Their True Essence was indeed running low.

"It'll take you at least half a day to recover your True Essence, right?" Yang Kai said with a bitter smile.

"Anyway, I won't go without being at my peak," Hu Jiao’er pouted her lips, looking provocatively alluring.

"I have a way," Yang Kai chuckled, directly extracting a drop of Wan Yao Ling Ye from the black book space, extending his finger toward Hu Jiao’er, and said, "Open wide!"

Hu Jiao’er instinctively opened her cherry-like mouth.

This unguarded reaction revealed that she held no significant suspicion toward Yang Kai.

He placed his finger inside her mouth, and Hu Jiao’er was momentarily taken aback before she suddenly realized and her almond eyes widened. A flush of red and a hint of anger appeared on her face, and just as she was about to angrily scold him, Yang Kai hurriedly urged, "Just absorb it."

Hu Jiao’er frowned, and the next moment, a sweet fragrance spread across her tongue. As this flavor expanded, a warm and powerful energy seeped into her belly, pouring into her limbs. In the blink of an eye, her nearly depleted True Essence surged back.

Unable to contain her astonishment, she suspiciously glanced at Yang Kai, finding that he exhibited neither lewdness nor impropriety, looking as earnest as ever.

Realizing that what Yang Kai had given her was indeed a precious treasure, Hu Jiao’er couldn’t bear to waste it. Suppressing her shyness, she rolled her fragrant tongue around Yang Kai's finger, sucking on it.

After a few motions, her beautiful eyes shimmered with bashfulness, her entire face blushing profusely.

Yang Kai chuckled lightly and slowly withdrew his finger, bringing along a glistening thread.

"Mm..." Hu Jiao’er suddenly felt a surge of embarrassment, letting out an involuntary moan in her throat.

Yang Kai felt quite awkward too, having not expected her response to be so intense. The lingering sensation of Hu Jiao’er’s soft little tongue still danced around his fingers, igniting a surge of emotions within him.

Subtly wiping his fingers on his clothes, he again extracted a drop of Wan Yao Ling Ye, extending it towards Hu Mei’er, saying, "It’s your turn."

Hu Mei’er turned her head away, shyly responding, "I... I think I’ll pass..."

At such a time…

How could she still think of such things?

"Mei’er, he’s giving us something to replenish our True Essence. It’s not what you think," Hu Jiao’er interjected as she sat cross-legged. The two sisters shared a bond, knowing what the other was thinking, and Hu Jiao’er quickly explained.

"That’s a good thing; hurry and eat it," she urged again.

Hu Mei’er then glanced at Yang Kai, who was looking back at her, and lightly opened her mouth to take his finger in. Compared to her sister, she was even shyer, showing no trace of her previous bold demeanor.

"You two refine it first; I'll stand guard," Yang Kai coughed lightly, boldly positioning himself in front of them.

"Mm." The alluring duo nodded slightly and swiftly began to operate the the Consonant Spirit Technique.

Meanwhile, on another stone platform, Shen Yi and Tao Yang guarded against the evil spirits while casting eager glances their way.

"Brother Yang has been gone for quite a while. Why hasn't he returned?" Shen Yi said, frowning in suspicion.

Tao Yang chuckled, "It seems Brother Yang is having a pleasant chat with them. Those two girls don’t seem to harbor any suspicions; they’re standing so close to him."

From their vantage point, though they couldn't see their faces, they could discern their blurred figures.

The distance between Yang Kai and the beautiful duo was merely three feet. If they had any wariness, they wouldn’t have allowed others to stand that close.

"Impressive! Looks like Brother Yang knows a thing or two about handling women," Shen Yi couldn't help but admire.

"Hmph!" Leng Shan snorted lightly.

Back in that distant place, she and Zi Mo had suffered a considerable loss at Yang Kai's hands, knowing well that he indeed had skills when it came to dealing with women.

She and Zi Mo had schemed extensively, hoping to corner Yang Kai. Yet, by the end, her hatred for him had diminished, and Zi Mo felt similarly, even harboring some gratitude.

If someone didn't possess a few tricks, how could they manage all of that?

"Here they come!" Shen Yi suddenly exclaimed, and everyone looked up to see Yang Kai and the two women flying toward them side by side.

"Impressive!" Tao Yang admired earnestly.

In just this short time, he had made those two women willingly follow him. Tao Yang doubted he could match such abilities, struggling even to dispel their wariness and hostility.

On a high platform not far away, Yu Qing's eyes narrowed, fixating on the enchanting figures of the twin beauties, his gaze flickering with lecherous intent, a cold smile of a sword playing on his lips.

Just as the three were midway through their flight, sudden changes occurred below.

Amidst the battle of countless evil spirits, the dense, ink-like malevolent energy surged violently. It was unclear what the evil spirits had done, but tendrils of chaotic energy, akin to soaring dragons, shot up from below, sealing off the space on all sides, leaving Yang Kai and the alluring duo with no escape.

"Watch out!" Shen Yi couldn't help but shout a warning.

Before his words finished echoing, bright light suddenly erupted. Yang Kai shone like a blazing sun, his True Yang Primordial Qi radiating outward.

The pure True Yang Primordial Qi quickly formed an oval light barrier, enveloping a radius of ten Zhang around Yang Kai.

A warm sensation spread forth, and both Hu Jiao’er and Hu Mei’er felt their bodies relax; the pervasive chill was entirely dispelled, and the attacks they had prepared to launch were retracted.

"Szzzz..."

The chaotic energy clashed against the light barrier, producing a series of piercing sounds, akin to salt being sprinkled into hot oil. The noise rang out incessantly, yet could not breach the barrier even a fraction, all kept out successfully.

"Wow... amazing!" Cheng Ying couldn't suppress a curse, wide-eyed with awe as he stared ahead.

"Sun attribute Primordial Qi that restrains the malevolent energy—truly formidable!" Tao Yang gaped at Yang Kai, "But how pure is this True Essence? Just what quality is it?"

Though none of them had ever ventured to touch the dense malevolent energy flowing like water, they could only imagine the unpleasantness it would induce. The fact that Yang Kai's True Yang Primordial Qi could ward off this malevolent energy surpassed all their expectations.

Did this mean Yang Kai could freely navigate the depths below? As long as he was careful not to be attacked by the evil spirits, of course.

After fending off the attack of the malevolent energy, Hu Jiao’er and Hu Mei’er took the initiative to draw closer to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai, feeling at ease, directly embraced a beauty in each arm, urging his True Yang Primordial Qi as they swiftly returned.

Once back on the high platform, Hu Jiao’er quickly broke free from his embrace, glaring at him fiercely, and softly uttering, "Once this ordeal is over, I’ll settle the score for your lecherous sins!"

"Haha..." Yang Kai chuckled awkwardly, not replying.

The arrival of the twin sisters significantly bolstered morale, especially since both were beauties of exceptional charm, drawing the gaze of everyone present as they stood shoulder to shoulder.

Leng Shan couldn’t help but inwardly compare herself to them, feeling a pang of sigh within her heart.

She realized that these two girls, be it in appearance or temperament, surpassed her by far; they were indeed supreme beauties.

"Greetings to the two young ladies!" Shen Yi clasped his fists in greeting.

"Hmph!" Hu Jiao’er showed clear disdain, though they hadn’t crossed paths before, the alluring duo was well aware that besides the Xiaoyao Sect, another group was hunting them—the Ghost King Valley. Hence, seeing them, their expressions naturally reflected their distaste.

Sensing Hu Jiao’er’s coldness, Shen Yi felt incredibly awkward and was at a loss for words.

"Jiao’er, since you came over first, have you noticed anything unusual? What exactly has happened here?" Yang Kai inquired; now was not the time for disputes.

Hu Jiao’er's expression turned frosty as she frowned and replied, "Mei’er and I were engaged in a fierce battle with an evil spirit when suddenly a massive burst of swirling malevolent energy surged from the ground. After its emergence, the evil spirit began to act strangely. As we sensed something was amiss, we wanted to flee, but numerous evil spirits rushed in from all sides, trapping us here."

"The malevolent energy that surged from the ground?" Shen Yi's expression shifted, questioning urgently, "Where is it?"

Hu Jiao’er didn’t retaliate; instead, she pointed in a direction and said, "Over there, do you see the malevolent energy swirling? That spot resembles a spring."

Following her gesture, the crowd looked over and indeed saw that area where the malevolent energy surged even more violently, as if all the chaotic energy was bubbling forth from below.

Moreover, as the malevolent energy increased, the swirling mass of it underground slowly rose.

"Could it be?" Shen Yi's complexion turned pale. "Could we be this unlucky?"

"What is it?" Yang Kai, noticing that he seemed to have some prior knowledge, furrowed his brows and asked.

"That’s the spring of evil spirits!" A distant, aged voice rang out, answering Shen Yi's question.

Everyone was taken aback, turning to see a group of people hurriedly flying toward them, followed closely by several purple evil spirits.

Another batch of people was being pursued!

The number of this group wasn’t too many, comprising just one old man and four young individuals, but the old man was undoubtedly a master of the Divine Roaming Realm!

Perceiving his strength, everyone revealed a hint of trepidation. Masters of the Divine Roaming Realm rarely appeared; they typically ventured deeper into the Bloodthirsty Evil Cave.

The old man was like a great eagle, protecting the four young ones by his side, his treasured artifact shimmering in brilliance, fending off any evil spirits that obstructed their path. Hovering in mid-air, he glanced around, landing his gaze on the group from the Xiaoyao Sect atop the high platform, and commanded, "Make way!"

Yu Qing's expression turned bitter, but he didn't dare refuse, quickly instructing his fellow disciples to step aside.

The old man guided the four youngsters down and casually cast a glance at Yu Qing, stating, "Xiaoyao Sect? No objections, right?"

Yu Qing laughed nervously, "Senior, you jest. This high platform is quite spacious!"

"Mm." The old man nodded slightly, appearing satisfied with Yu Qing's concession.
